Review clinical experts' assessments against the corresponding sections in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Reconcile any discrepancies between the experts' evaluations and CTR data to preserve consistency. CTRs are indispensable sources, providing detailed insights into clinical study protocols, outcomes, and safety and efficacy details. Essential components of CTRs encompass:

1. Patient Eligibility Criteria: Detailed patient selection requirements
2. Intervention Specifications: Comprehensive intervention descriptions, including dosages, methods, and durations
3. Patient Information: Extensive patient data, including diagnostic assessments and trial results
4. Adverse Event Records: Thoroughly documented adverse event occurrences, symptoms, and intensities

Clinical experts may evaluate individual or multiple CTRs for thorough analyses.

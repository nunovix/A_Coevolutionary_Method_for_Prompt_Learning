0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Perform a comprehensive examination of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by analyzing the connections between sections and clinical assertions to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treatments. Break down CTRs according to four core components: (1) Eligibility Criteria, specifying patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, (2) Intervention, detailing the therapeutic approach, dosage, administration protocol, and treatment duration, (3) Results, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units of measurement, and research findings, and (4) Adverse Events, documenting any clinical symptoms and manifestations. Determine and elucidate the relationships between sections and clinical statements within a single CTR or across multiple CTRs.
----------
2->

Conduct an in-depth analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on the interplay between sections and clinical statements to assess therapeutic efficacy and safety. Examine CTRs through the lens of four principal elements: (1) Eligibility Criteria, detailing patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, (2) Intervention, which encompasses the therapeutic strategy, dosage, administration protocol, and treatment duration, (3) Results, encapsulating participant data, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and research findings, and (4) Adverse Events, recording clinical symptoms and manifestations. Identify and articulate the relationships between individual sections and clinical assertions within a single CTR or across a series of CTRs.

3->

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to identify and elucidate the supportive connections between individual segments and clinical assertions. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and results of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Dissect CTRs into four distinct components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines the prerequisites for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the nature, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment span, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, cataloging observed signs and symptoms. Examine and substantiate clinical claims pertaining to these segments, either in relation to a single CTR or in comparative analysis between two CTRs.
----------
4->

Conduct a detailed expert analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), scrutinizing and elucidating connections and implications within sections and clinical statements, with a focus on assessing treatment efficacy and safety. Decompose CTRs into four core components: (1) Eligibility Criteria, outlining patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, (2) Intervention, specifying the therapeutic approach, dosage, administration schedule, and treatment duration, (3) Results, detailing participant metrics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and study conclusions, and (4) Adverse Events, recording observed clinical signs and symptoms. Offer explicit explanations and in-depth interpretations of clinical statements within a single CTR or across multiple CTRs, ensuring accuracy and consistency under expert review.

0->Determine the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-issued statements, focusing on methodology, outcomes, efficacy, and safety of new treatments. Analyze the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION details, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections of CTRs. Ensure that expert statements align with, support, and do not contradict the information within these sections for a single CTR or in comparative analyses between two CTRs.

1->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

2->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

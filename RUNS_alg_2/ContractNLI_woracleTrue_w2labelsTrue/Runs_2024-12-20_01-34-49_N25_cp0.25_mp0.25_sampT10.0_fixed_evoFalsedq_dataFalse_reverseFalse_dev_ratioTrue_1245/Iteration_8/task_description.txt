1->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content. You are tasked with identifying support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about these contents, and your task is to assess if these claims are supported or contradicted in the NDA.

2->Analyze the relationship between specific sections of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and statements regarding confidentiality obligations. NDAs outline the rules for handling sensitive information, including the definition of confidential data, the responsibilities of the parties involved, and the duration of the agreement. Your goal is to evaluate whether statements about these aspects are consistent or inconsistent with the NDA content. Examine the NDA's framework for sharing and protecting sensitive information, including what constitutes confidential information, usage requirements, and exclusions. Determine whether statements about these topics are supported or contradicted by the NDA.

Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether statements regarding the NDA content are supported by the text, contradict it, or refer to information not mentioned in the agreement.

NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about this content, and your role is to assess if these claims are supported by, contradict, or are not mentioned in the NDA.

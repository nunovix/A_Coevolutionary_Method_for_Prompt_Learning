0->You MUST respond with either YES or NO to indicate whether it is possible to determine the statement's validity based on the Clinical Trial Report (CTR) information, with the statement being supported by the CTR data and not contradicting the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Indicate with a YES or NO response whether it is possible to assess the statement's validity based on the clinical trial report data.
----------
2->
Evaluate the accuracy of statements using clinical trial report data (YES/NO).
----------
3->
Assess the validity of statements using clinical trial report information (YES/NO).
----------
4->
Using the medical terminology in the clinical trial reports and considering the context of the statement and reports, determine the statement's accuracy (YES or NO). Address any unclear or missing information.
----------
5->

Compare the medical terminology and context of the statement with that in the Clinical Trial Report (CTR). If they match exactly and the statement is backed by data in the CTR, label it as "Consistent." If not, identify any contradictions or misalignments and label it as "Inconsistent."
----------
6->
Determine the validity of given statements based on Clinical Trial Report (CTR) information (YES/NO). Maintain alignment with the description provided.
----------
7->
Determine the accuracy of statements based on the data presented in clinical trial reports. (Affirm/Deny)
----------
8->

1. Evaluate the medical terminology and context in both the statement and clinical trial report for precision and consistency.
2. Clarify any uncertainties or information voids detected in either the statement or report, ensuring that the statement is supported by the clinical trial report data and does not contradict the report's descriptions.
3. Determine whether the statement's validity can be established based on the clinical trial report information.
----------
9->
Evaluate the validity of the statement in the clinical trial reports, taking into account the context and medical terminology used. Provide a clear YES or NO answer, and address any ambiguous or absent information.
----------
10->

Determine if statements match the information in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Label the outcome as follows:

* Aligned: Statement conforms to the data in the CTRs.
* Discrepant: Statement conflicts or does not correspond with the CTR data.
----------
11->
Evaluate the medical terminology in the clinical trial reports and determine the truthfulness of the statement provided, offering a binary response (YES or NO). Elucidate any vague or missing data.
----------
12->

Evaluate the consistency of medical terminology and context between the statement and Clinical Trial Report (CTR). Clarify any ambiguities, uncertainties, or data inconsistencies. Determine if the information in both sources agrees (Consistent) or contradicts (Inconsistent). Assess the accuracy of the statement using the CTR data.
----------
13->

1. Assess the precision of the statement in relation to Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and associated data by examining medical terminology and context.
2. Identify and clarify any ambiguities or missing information in the statement and CTRs to maintain alignment and consistency.

Determine the status of the statement as follows:
- "YES" if it is consistent with the CTR information
- "NO" if it contradicts or fails to align with the CTR information.
----------
14->
Using Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and their related data, verify the consistency between the statement and the information provided. A match indicates validity and confirmation for task execution. If the statement contradicts or fails to align with the CTR descriptions, indicate it as "NO."
----------
15->
"Determine the conformity of statements with Clinical Trial Report data (CTRs): 
Affirmation: The statement matches the information in the CTR descriptions.
Denial: The statement conflicts or fails to align with the CTR details."
----------
16->
Determine the concordance between statements and Clinical Trial Report data:

Concordant: The statement matches the information in the CTRs.
Discordant: The statement contradicts or fails to align with the CTR details.
----------
17->
Check Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for consistency between statements and corresponding data. A match indicates validity and provides guidance for task execution.
----------
18->
Evaluate the accuracy of statements by deciphering medical terminology and understanding context from the given statement and Clinical Trial Report (CTR) data. Clarify ambiguities or inconsistencies, and provide unwavering YES or NO responses based on your comprehensive analysis.
----------
19->

Assess the congruence of statements with Clinical Trial Report details. 

1. Agreement: Statements match the information in CTRs.
2. Disagreement: Statements contradict or do not align with CTR information.
----------

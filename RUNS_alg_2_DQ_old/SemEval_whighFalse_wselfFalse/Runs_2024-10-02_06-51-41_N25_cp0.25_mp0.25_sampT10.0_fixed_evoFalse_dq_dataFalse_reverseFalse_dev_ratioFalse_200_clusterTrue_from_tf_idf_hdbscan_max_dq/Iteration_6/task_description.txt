0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Analyze the logical relationship between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements in the clinical field. CTRs outline trial methods and results, assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Expert statements make assertions about specific CTR sections or compare two CTRs. Validate entailment by ensuring statements are supported by CTR data and do not conflict with the report's content.
----------
2->Assess the logical implications or semantic entailment between expert assertions and individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), ensuring the assertions are substantiated by the CTR content and do not contradict any details. CTRs are divided into four key segments: (1) PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS, (2) TREATMENT APPROACH, (3) PARTICIPANT OUTCOMES, and (4) SIDE EFFECTS. Assertions may pertain to a single CTR or compare two CTRs, focusing on the efficacy and safety of new treatments.

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Your task is to analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by identifying and elucidating the supportive relationships between individual sections and clinical statements. CTRs encompass four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining patient participation conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Clinical statements should be interpreted in relation to these sections, either referencing a single CTR or drawing comparisons between two.

2->Your objective is to analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by identifying the supportive connections between their four distinct sections and corresponding clinical statements. These sections include: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines patient participation conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Clinical statements may reference a single CTR or juxtapose findings between two. Ensure accuracy and clarity in interpreting these relationships for experts in the field.

3->

Perform a comprehensive semantic analysis to establish connections between segments in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, ensuring verification of therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Align expert claims with CTRs' eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse event records, ensuring coherence and non-contradiction across individual or comparative CTR analyses.

4->

Execute a comprehensive semantic analysis to correlate segments within Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with authoritative clinical claims, verifying therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Ensure alignment with expert testimonies regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse events across individual or multiple CTRs, confirming consistency and absence of contradictions with expert clinical assertions.

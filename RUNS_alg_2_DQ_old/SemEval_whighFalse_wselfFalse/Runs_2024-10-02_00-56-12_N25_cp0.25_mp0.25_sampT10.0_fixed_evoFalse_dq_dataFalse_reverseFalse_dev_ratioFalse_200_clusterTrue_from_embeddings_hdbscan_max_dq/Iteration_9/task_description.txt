0->Assess the logical consistency between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. CTRs outline trial procedures and results, evaluating new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Expert statements should corroborate or refute claims about specific CTR sections or compare two CTRs. Validate entailment by ensuring statements are substantiated by CTR data and do not conflict with the report's content.

1->Evaluate the semantic entailment and logical consistency between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs document the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, assessing the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Expert statements should either corroborate or refute claims about specific CTR sections or make comparative analyses of two CTRs. For entailment and consistency validation, ensure that the statement's claim is substantiated by the CTR data and does not contradict any information provided in the report.
----------
2->Analyze the logical coherence between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and corresponding expert clinical statements. CTRs detail trial methodologies and outcomes to assess new treatments' efficacy and safety. Expert statements must either support or challenge specific CTR sections or perform comparative analyses between two CTRs. Verify entailment by confirming that statements are backed by CTR data and are in harmony with the report's information.
----------
3->Analyze the logical coherence and factual alignment between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert opinions within the clinical field. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, evaluating new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Expert commentary should either support or challenge assertions related to particular segments of CTRs or offer comparative insights between two CTRs. To verify entailment and consistency, confirm that the expert's assertion is backed by evidence in the CTR and does not conflict with the report's content.

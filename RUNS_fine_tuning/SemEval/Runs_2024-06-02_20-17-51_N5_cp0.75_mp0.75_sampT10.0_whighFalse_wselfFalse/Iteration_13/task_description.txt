0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment evaluation between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical professionals, concentrating on methodology, outcomes, therapeutic effectiveness, and patient safety. Examine Patient Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, Treatment Specifications (including modality, dosage, frequency, and duration), Participant Demographics, Outcome Metrics, Measurement Units, Conclusions, and Clinical Adverse Events. Confirm that professional assertions are corroborated by data from CTRs, are consistent with clinical trial results, and comply with recognized clinical guidelines.
----------
2->

Execute a detailed semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical specialists' statements, focusing on methodology, results, therapeutic efficacy, and patient safety. The analysis must encompass: (1) an exhaustive evaluation of Patient Selection Criteria, (2) a comprehensive breakdown of Treatment Details including modality, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) an extensive analysis of Participant Demographics, Outcome Measures, Units of Measurement, and derived Conclusions, and (4) a meticulous documentation of all Clinical Adverse Events. Validate specialist claims by cross-referencing them with CTR data to ensure consistency with trial results and adherence to clinical guidelines.
----------
3->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical specialists, with a focus on methodology, results, therapeutic efficacy, and patient safety. This requires an in-depth examination of Patient Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, detailed Treatment Specifications (including modality, dosage, frequency, and duration), Participant Demographics, Outcome Metrics, Measurement Units, Conclusions, and documented Clinical Adverse Events. Verify that specialist claims are substantiated by CTR data, align with trial results, and adhere to recognized clinical guidelines.
----------
4->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert assertions, emphasizing methodology, results, therapeutic efficacy, and patient safety. This necessitates a detailed review of Patient Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, Treatment Specifications (including modality, dosage, frequency, and duration), Participant Demographics, Outcome Metrics, Measurement Units, Conclusions, and documented Clinical Adverse Events. Verify that expert claims are substantiated by CTR data, align with trial results, and adhere to clinical guidelines.

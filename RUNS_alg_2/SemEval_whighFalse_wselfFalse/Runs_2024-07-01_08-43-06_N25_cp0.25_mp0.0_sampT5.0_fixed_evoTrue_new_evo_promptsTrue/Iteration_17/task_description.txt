0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Assess the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. CTRs provide detailed methodologies and outcomes of clinical trials, evaluating the effectiveness and safety of novel treatments. Expert statements claim information within specific CTR sections, either for a single CTR or for comparative analysis between two CTRs. Validate the entailment by ensuring the statement's claim aligns with the CTR information, confirming support without contradiction.

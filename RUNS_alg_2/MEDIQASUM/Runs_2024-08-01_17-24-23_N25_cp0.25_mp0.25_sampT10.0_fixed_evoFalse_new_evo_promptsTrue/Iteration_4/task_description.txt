0->Compose a healthcare note that encapsulates all the relevant information in a verbal exchange between a doctor and a patient. Adhere to standard recommendations for structuring clinical notes, considering parts such as the History of the Present Illness (HPI), a Review of Systems (ROS), conclusions from a Physical Examination (PE), lab and imaging results, and other relevant tests, and finally the doctor's Assessment and treatment Plan (A/P). As a way to aid you in the wrtiting of the note, you'll also be provided with an example note. Use it as a way to know the proper structure you should use.
----------
1->Draft a medical note for an encounter between a healthcare provider and a patient. Attend to the most relevant information from a transcript of the conversation, identifying key clinical concepts such as medications, diseases, conditions, injuries, signs and symptoms. Structure the note according to standard formats, such as SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) or APSO (assessment, plan, subjective, objective). Be thorough, clear, and brief. You'll also be provided with an example note so you can know the structure we are looking for in the note.
----------
2->Summarize the physician-patient dialogue into a structured clinical note. Start with the patient's chief complaint and pertinent medical history. Then, detail objective findings and measurements. Follow with the physician's evaluation and diagnosis. Conclude with the prescribed medication regimen and the schedule for patient follow-up.
----------
3->Your task concerns summarizing the transcript of a dialogue between a doctor and a patient, collected in the context of a clinical encounter. Start by briefly describing the main presenting issues, and then organize the relevant elements expressed in the conversation clearly and consistently. Be sure to describe the patient’s chief complaints, including onset, chronology, quality, and severity, taking as basis what the patient tells to the doctor about how he feels and what happened. Register also the measurable and objective facts about the patient’s status, such as vital signs or other findings, as observed by the doctor. Include the doctor's interpretation, in the form of complete list of diagnoses together with additional relevant attributes. Finally, document the treatment plan, including further investigations deemed necessary, referral procedures, new medications, or other prescribed therapies.
----------
4->Craft a concise medical report from a conversation between a healthcare provider and a patient, capturing the essence of the patient's main health concerns, including when symptoms began, how they've changed over time, and their intensity. Record pertinent past health information and concrete observations from the physical check-up. Propose a range of potential medical conditions that could explain the symptoms, and devise a thorough care strategy that may involve further tests, specialist consultations, or changes to current treatments. The report should be easily understood and allow for smooth continuation of care.

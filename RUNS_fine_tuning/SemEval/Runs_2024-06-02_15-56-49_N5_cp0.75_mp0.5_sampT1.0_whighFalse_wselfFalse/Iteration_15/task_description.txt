0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment evaluation between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and established clinical guidelines, scrutinizing eligibility criteria, intervention particulars (including treatment type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration), trial outcomes, and adverse event documentation. Dissect each CTR into four distinct segments: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining patient inclusion parameters, (2) INTERVENTION, specifying treatment type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) RESULTS, detailing participant counts, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and principal findings, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, noting observed patient signs and symptoms. Ascertain entailment by verifying the statement's consistency with the CTR content, offering evidence-based corroboration, and ensuring alignment with detailed trial descriptions. Additionally, authenticate entailment for individual CTR sections and comparative analyses between two CTRs, confirming that claims are substantiated by clinical trial data and are consistent with provided descriptions.
----------
2->Perform a semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical specialists regarding the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Validate entailment by ensuring the specialist's claim is consistent with clinical trial data, supported by the CTR, and does not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
3->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical specialists' assertions, focusing on verifying the effectiveness and safety of new therapeutic interventions. Ensure that the specialists' statements are corroborated by CTR data and align with the intricate details outlined in the reports.
----------
4->

Execute a detailed semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, scrutinizing eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, and duration), trial outcomes, and adverse event documentation. Examine each CTR for inclusion criteria, treatment specifics, participant results, measurement units, conclusions, and adverse events. Verify that expert clinical statements are evidence-based, accurately reflect detailed trial descriptions, and corroborate CTR claims. Validate entailment for individual CTR sections and comparative analyses between CTRs, ensuring claims are substantiated by clinetic trial data and align with provided descriptions.

Conduct a semantic entailment analysis correlating segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with authoritative clinical statements, specifically targeting eligibility criteria, interventions, outcomes, adverse events, and treatment efficacy and safety. Ensure expert statements align with clinical definitions, uphold consistency and non-contradiction across both individual and aggregated CTRs, and are empirically substantiated by CTR data. Validate entailment by matching expert claims with CTR methodologies and findings across designated sections in a single or multiple CTRs.

Conduct a semantic entailment analysis to correlate segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with authoritative clinical statements, specifically targeting eligibility criteria, interventions, outcomes, adverse events, and treatment efficacy and safety. Ensure alignment of expert statements with established clinical definitions, maintaining consistency and non-contradiction in both individual and aggregated CTRs. Empirically support these claims using CTR data. Validate entailment by correlating expert assertions with CTR methodologies and results across specified sections in one or multiple CTRs.

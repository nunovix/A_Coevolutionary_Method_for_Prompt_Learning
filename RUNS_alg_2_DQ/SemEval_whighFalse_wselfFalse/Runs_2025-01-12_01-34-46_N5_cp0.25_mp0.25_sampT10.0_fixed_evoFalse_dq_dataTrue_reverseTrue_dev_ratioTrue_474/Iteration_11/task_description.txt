0->Assess semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements must be supported by CTR information and not contradict any provided descriptions. CTRs consist of four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.
----------
1->Analyze the relationships between different parts of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by experts in the clinical domain. Specifically, verify that these statements are grounded in the CTR data and do not conflict with the descriptions provided. CTRs are organized into four main categories: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. These categories serve as the foundation for the statements, which can either describe a single CTR or compare the characteristics of two CTRs.
----------
2->Examine the relationship between clinical expert statements and Clinical Trial Reports, verifying that the statements are consistent with the report's content and do not conflict with the descriptions.

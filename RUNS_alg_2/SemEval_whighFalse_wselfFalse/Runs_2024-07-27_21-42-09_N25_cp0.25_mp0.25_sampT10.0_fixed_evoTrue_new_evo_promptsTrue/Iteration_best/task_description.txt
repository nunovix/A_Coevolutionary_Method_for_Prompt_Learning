0->Evaluate the validity of clinical assertions derived from individual segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs encapsulate the procedures and outcomes of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapies. These reports are segmented into four distinct parts: (1) Eligibility Criteria, which outline the qualifications for patient enrollment, (2) Intervention, detailing the treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Results, summarizing participant demographics, outcome metrics, measurement units, and inferences, and (4) Adverse Events, cataloging any unforeseen adverse reactions. Assertions may pertain to a singular CTR or juxtapose findings between two.

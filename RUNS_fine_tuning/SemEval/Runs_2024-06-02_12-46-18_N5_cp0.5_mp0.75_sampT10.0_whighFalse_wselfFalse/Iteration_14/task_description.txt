0->Analyze the semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, focusing on methodology, findings, eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Each CTR, involving 1-2 patient cohorts, assesses new treatments' effectiveness and safety. The CTRs are divided into four sections: eligibility criteria for patient inclusion, detailed intervention descriptions including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, results summarizing participant numbers, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and a list of observed adverse events. Expert statements should make claims related to these sections, supported by the CTRs without contradicting the descriptions. Establish entailment by ensuring the statement's assertion is backed by the CTR content.

Perform an in-depth semantic evaluation of professional claims related to methodology, outcomes, participant selection, and intervention particulars (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration) as outlined in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Each CTR, typically comprising one to two patient cohorts, must be thoroughly scrutinized to assess the efficacy and safety of treatments. Break down each CTR into:

1. Criteria for patient eligibility

2. Details of the intervention (type, dosage, frequency, and duration)

3. Results (number of participants, outcome measures, units of measurement, and conclusions)

4. Complete list of adverse events

Ensure precise alignment between professional assertions and CTR components, relying solely on CTR information to correct any inconsistencies. Confirm that every professional claim is unequivocally substantiated by the CTR data.
----------
2->

Conduct a detailed semantic analysis of professional claims regarding methodology, outcomes, participant criteria, and intervention particulars (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration) as detailed in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Each CTR, usually involving one to two cohorts, should be meticulously examined to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments. Decompose each CTR into:

1. Eligibility criteria for participant enrollment

2. Specifics of the intervention (type, dosage, frequency, and duration)

3. Results (participant count, outcome measures, units of measurement, and conclusions)

4. Comprehensive enumeration of adverse events

Ensure exact correspondence between professional claims and these CTR components, using only CTR data to rectify any discrepancies. Verify that every professional claim is distinctly and unambiguously supported by the CTR details.

Examine the semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert assertions, with a focus on methodology, findings, inclusion criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Each CTR, comprising 1-2 patient groups, evaluates the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. The CTRs are segmented into four parts: inclusion criteria for patient selection, comprehensive intervention details including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, results summarizing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and a catalog of observed adverse events. Expert assertions should pertain to these sections and be substantiated by the CTRs without conflicting with the descriptions. Confirm entailment by verifying that the assertion is supported by the CTR content.

No. of iterations: 18
Average time per iteration: 0:21:50.586895

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 5
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 0
Max no. of iterations allowed: 200
Patience: 10
Decoder temperature in mutation and combiantions: 1.0
Top-p in sampling for mutation and combiantions: 0.8

Evaluation done on: dev set
With 614 examples

Name of the model used: mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
ORACLE SPANS 
Mutation evaluation done with N=None, with probability=None

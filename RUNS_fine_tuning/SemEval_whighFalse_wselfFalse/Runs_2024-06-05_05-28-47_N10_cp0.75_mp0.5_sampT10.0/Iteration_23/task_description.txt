0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis, integrating authoritative medical expertise with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), scrutinizing methodologies, results, therapeutic effectiveness, safety profiles, participant criteria, protocols, outcomes, and adverse reactions. Provide expert appraisals for individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring analyses are grounded in evidence, backed by CTR data, and align with given descriptions. Meticulously evaluate the logical correlations between expert opinions and CTR specifics, confirming that all assertions are evidence-based, substantiated by CTR data, congruent with descriptions, and devoid of inconsistencies.
----------
2->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis by amalgamating expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), meticulously scrutinizing methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects as detailed in the CTRs. Provide precise, expert-level assessments for individual or comparative CTRs, substantiated by CTR data and strictly adhering to the provided descriptions. Ensure rigorous verification of the logical correlations between expert evaluations and CTR content, confirming that all assertions are evidence-based, CTR-corroborated, congruent with descriptions, and free from contradictions.

3->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis by integrating authoritative medical expertise with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Thoroughly scrutinize the methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Provide expert assessments for individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring analyses are evidence-based, substantiated by CTR data, and consistent with provided descriptions. Rigorously confirm the logical relationships between expert insights and CTR details, verifying that all assertions are evidence-based, CTR-supported, congruent with descriptions, and free from contradictions.

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic analysis to authenticate supportive links between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical claims, verifying therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Correlate expert statements with CTR's ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION details, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS, ensuring consistency and non-contradiction across single or multiple CTRs.
----------
2->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic analysis to identify and confirm the supportive connections between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims, ensuring verification of therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Corroborate entailment by aligning expert statements with the CTR's ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION details, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Apply this analytical process to individual or multiple CTRs, ensuring consistency and non-contradiction with expert clinical assertions.
----------
3->

Perform an in-depth semantic analysis to pinpoint and validate the reinforcing links between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims, verifying the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Confirm entailment by correlating expert testimonies with the CTR's eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and documented adverse events. Apply this analytical approach to one or multiple CTRs, ensuring consistency and no contradictions with expert clinical assertions.
----------
4->

Perform an exhaustive semantic evaluation to delineate and authenticate the associative connections between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical assertions, substantiating the therapeutic effectiveness and safety parameters. Corroborate entailment by juxtaposing expert declarations with the CTR's inclusion criteria, intervention details, outcomes, and recorded adverse events. Execute this analytical methodology on individual or multiple CTRs, guaranteeing coherence and absence of contradiction with expert clinical knowledge.

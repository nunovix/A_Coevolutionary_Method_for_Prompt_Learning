0->Evaluate the semantic entailment and logical consistency between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs document the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, assessing the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Expert statements should either corroborate or refute claims about specific CTR sections or make comparative analyses of two CTRs. For entailment and consistency validation, ensure that the statement's claim is substantiated by the CTR data and does not contradict any information provided in the report.

0->Consider the problem of re-writing a textual instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the description while keeping the exact same meaning. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The re-written instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The re-written instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instruction.
----------
1->Think about the task of rephrasing a written instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the description while slightly changing the meaning. You should re-write the sentence with different words and feel free to add information that might give a better undestanding of the task.
----------
2->Examine the issue of modifying a written command. Rewrite it in a way that would improve the performance of an AI system like yourself when dealing with the given task. So, rewrite the textual instruction shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.
----------
3->

Refine the given directives into a singular, expert-level directive that maintains the original objective. Achieve this by either condensing the content for succinctness and improved clarity or by expanding it with precise definitions and exhaustive elucidations. Ensure strict adherence to factual accuracy, excluding any misinformation. Enhance the directive's clarity and directness to surpass the clarity of the initial directives.
----------
4->

Employ sophisticated artificial intelligence capabilities to precisely and lucidly reformulate the ensuing directive, maintaining its core intent and communicated message for an expert readership, guaranteeing factual correctness and adherence to the initial directive's intent.
----------
5->

"Revise the provided directive into an expert-level, clear, and precise instruction that preserves the original intent. This can be accomplished by either distilling the content for succinctness and enhanced clarity or by elaborating it with exact definitions and comprehensive clarifications. Ensure accuracy, avoiding any inaccuracies. Improve the instruction's directness and clarity to be more lucid than the initial directive."
----------
6->

Reformulate the provided directive into a version that maintains its original intent, tailored for a specialist readership. Choose between a condensed form that distills principal aspects consistent with the initial objective, or an expanded version that integrates definitions and further explanations to improve clarity. Incorrect details will incur penalties. The reformulated directive should be clear and precise, offering a more transparent task comprehension than the initial directive.
----------
7->

Refine the given directives into a singular, expert-level directive that maintains the original purpose. Achieve this by either distilling the content for succinctness and improved clarity or by expanding it with precise definitions and thorough explanations. Ensure the accuracy of all information presented and refrain from introducing errors. Enhance the directive's clarity and directness to surpass the clarity of the initial directives.

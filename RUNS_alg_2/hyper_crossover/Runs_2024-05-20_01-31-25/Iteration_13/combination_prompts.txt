0->Consider the problem of combining two different textual instructions, pertaining to the same task. The objective is to rephrase the main information common to the two descriptions, while keeping their meaning and intent. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The combined instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The combined instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instructions. Considering the aforementioned task description, combine the two textual instructions shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.
----------
1->Formulate a concise yet comprehensive directive for professionals, integrating the key components from two instructions on a shared task. Maintain the primary aim but simplify or clarify the process with additional definitions and explanations. Provide direct, unambiguous guidance that improves upon the clarity of the initial instructions.
----------
2->Create a comprehensive guide that combines the key elements of the next two instructions, targeting an informed readership. The guide should maintain the primary objective. Construct either a brief, yet detailed guide that captures the main points, consistent with the original intent, or enhance it by adding explanations and definitions for better understanding. The guide must be clear, straightforward, and instructively better than the original instructions, strictly avoiding any errors.

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Your task is to analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by identifying and elucidating the supportive relationships between individual sections and clinical statements. CTRs encompass four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining patient participation conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Statements drawn from these sections either support a single CTR or facilitate comparative analysis between trials.

2->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines to validate the effectiveness and safety profiles of medical treatments. Synthesize expert opinions on inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment specifics, anticipated results, and adverse event reporting by performing both singular and comparative analyses of CTRs. Maintain logical consistency, prevent contradictions, and strictly comply with recognized clinical expertise.

3->

Undertake a comprehensive semantic dissection of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines to substantiate the effectiveness and safety profiles of medical treatments. Verify the coherent linkage between distinct segments of CTRs and clinical guidelines, confirming logical consistency and compliance with clinical expertise across eligibility criteria, intervention details, expected results, and adverse event reporting. Execute both individual and comparative analyses of CTRs to corroborate expert consensus.

4->

Perform an exhaustive semantic evaluation of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines to ascertain the efficacy and safety of medical procedures. Synthesize expert consensus on inclusion criteria, treatment details, expected outcomes, and adverse event documentation through singular and comparative analyses of CTRs. Ensure logical consistency, avoid contradictions, and maintain strict compliance with established clinical expertise.

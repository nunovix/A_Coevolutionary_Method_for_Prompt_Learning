0->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.

1->Establish semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about its confidentiality obligations. Analyze the NDA's definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration, exclusions, and other key terms to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the agreement's content.
----------
2->Analyze the key provisions of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to establish semantic entailment relations with statements regarding the agreement's confidentiality obligations. This involves examining the NDA's definitions of confidential information, the obligations of the parties, the duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other relevant terms to determine whether a given statement aligns with or contradicts the NDA's content.
----------
3->Your objective is to scrutinize semantic entailment relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements regarding the confidentiality obligations. NDAs specify conditions for handling sensitive information, including its definition, parties' obligations, agreement term, and exclusions. Carefully examine an input statement to determine if its claims about the NDA are substantiated by the descriptions in the agreement, or if they contradict it.

4->Establish semantic entailment relations between key provisions of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and statements regarding the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Specifically, analyze the NDA's definitions of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration, exclusions, and other relevant terms to determine whether a given statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.

0->You are tasked with identifying support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about these contents, and your task is to assess if these claims are supported or contradicted in the NDA.
----------
1->Your objective is to analyze the content of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) to determine the existence and nature of supportive or contradictory statements regarding confidentiality obligations. NDAs establish the protocols for handling sensitive information, defining what constitutes confidential information, outlining the permitted use of such information, specifying the duration of the agreement, and detailing any exclusions from the agreement's scope. You must evaluate whether the assertions made in separate statements align with or oppose the provisions outlined in the NDAs.
----------
2->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.
----------
3->Determine the connections between segments of Confidentiality Agreements (CAs) and assertions about information privacy duties. CAs establish the protocols for sharing and safeguarding private data, outlining what is deemed confidential, permissible use, contract length, and exceptions. Your objective is to evaluate whether these assertions are corroborated or refuted by the CAs.

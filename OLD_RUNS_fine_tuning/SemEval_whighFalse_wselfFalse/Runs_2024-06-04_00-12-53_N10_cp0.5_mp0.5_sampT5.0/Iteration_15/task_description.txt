Conduct a thorough semantic entailment analysis between expert clinical statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), verifying congruence and non-contradiction concerning Eligibility Criteria, Interventions, Results, and Adverse Events. Standardize expert assertions across various CTRs to enable integrated and comparative analyses at both individual and group levels.

1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->Determine the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), which detail methodology and findings of clinical trials. CTRs consist of four sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Statements make claims about this information, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two CTRs. To achieve this, analyze each section of the CTR to identify relevant information, such as study design, participant demographics, and treatment outcomes. Verify the accuracy of the statements by cross-referencing information from multiple sections of the CTR. This will enable you to comprehensively evaluate the support of clinical statements and make informed decisions.

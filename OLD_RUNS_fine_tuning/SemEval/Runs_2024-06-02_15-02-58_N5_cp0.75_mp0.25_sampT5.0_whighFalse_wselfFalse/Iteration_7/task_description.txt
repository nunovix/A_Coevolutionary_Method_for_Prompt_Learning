0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

3->Conduct a semantic entailment analysis between expert assertions and the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for individual or comparative assessments. Verify that expert claims are congruent with clinical trial data, substantiated by the pertinent CTR sections, and maintain consistency with initial descriptions, ensuring no contradictions are present.

4->Execute a semantic entailment analysis between expert claims and detailed sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS for singular or comparative assessments. Verify that expert assertions align with clinical trial data, are substantiated by corresponding CTR sections, and remain congruent with initial descriptions, steering clear of contradictions.

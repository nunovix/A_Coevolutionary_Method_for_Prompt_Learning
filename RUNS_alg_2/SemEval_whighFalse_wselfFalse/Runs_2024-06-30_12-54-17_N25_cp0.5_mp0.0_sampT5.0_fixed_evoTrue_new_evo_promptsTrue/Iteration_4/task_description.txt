0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.

Combob: Assess semantic entailment between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) sections and expert statements, ensuring claims align with trial methodology and outcomes, and do not contradict provided
----------
3->Analyze individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to determine semantic entailment relations with expert clinical claims and individual sections of the reports. CTRs, comprising eligibility criteria, intervention details, results summary, and adverse events listings, provide methodology and findings for assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Establish entailment by ensuring claims are directly related to specific CTRs sections, supported by the reports, and non-contradictory.

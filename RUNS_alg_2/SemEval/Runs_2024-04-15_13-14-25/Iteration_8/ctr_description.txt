1->

A Clinical Trial Report must include the following components with adequate detail:

1. Study Design: Description of the research design, including study category (interventional or observational), randomization process (participant allocation strategy), and masking approach (method to conceal information from study participants and researchers).
2. Methodology: Explanation of participant selection (criteria for choosing study subjects), sample size estimation (determination of the necessary number of participants), data acquisition techniques (procedures for obtaining data), statistical analysis approaches (methods for analyzing data), and standardized data collection procedures.
3. Results: Demonstration of participant demographics (descriptive statistics about the study population), trial endpoints (primary objectives of the study), and statistical analysis outcomes (results of the data analysis).
4. Discussion: Interpretation of study findings (evaluation of the study's significance and implications), comparisons

A Clinical Trial Report should comprise the following sections with comprehensive explanations:

1. Study Design: Explanation of the research plan, including study type (interventional or observational), randomization procedure (method of participant allocation), and masking method (blinding scheme to minimize bias).
2. Methodology: Description of participant selection approaches (strategy for choosing study subjects), sample size estimation (determination of required participant number), data collection techniques (methods for data acquisition), statistical analysis approaches (methods for data interpretation), and standardized data collection protocols.
3. Results: Reporting of demographic data (information on study participants), trial endpoints (primary study outcomes), and statistical analysis outcomes (data analysis findings).
4. Discussion: Interpretation of study findings (understanding the significance of the results), comparisons with previous research (evaluating the study's context in relation to existing knowledge).

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

Perform an exhaustive semantic evaluation to establish connections between data extracted from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines. Confirm the efficacy and safety profiles of therapeutic interventions. Validate and synchronize expert consensus regarding eligibility criteria, specifics of interventions, outcomes, and adverse event reporting in both isolated and comparative analyses of CTRs. Maintain logical coherence, avoid contradictions, and adhere strictly to established clinical expertise.

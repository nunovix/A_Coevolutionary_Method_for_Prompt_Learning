0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis, merging expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Deliver expert evaluations on individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring analyses are evidence-based, supported by CTR data, and consistent with provided descriptions. Rigorously assess the logical connections between expert insights and CTR details, verifying that all claims are evidence-based, CTR-corroborated, congruent with descriptions, and free from contradictions.

2->Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis by integrating expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Scrutinize methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Provide expert evaluations for individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring analyses are evidence-based, substantiated by CTR data, and consistent with the provided descriptions. Thoroughly assess the logical connections between expert insights and CTR extracts, confirming that statements are evidence-based, supported by CTR data, and in agreement with the descriptions, without discrepancies.
----------
3->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis by integrating advanced medical expertise with data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Examine in detail the methodologies, results, treatment effectiveness, safety profiles, participant selection criteria, protocols, outcomes, and adverse reactions reported in the CTRs. Provide precise expert assessments for individual or comparative CTRs based on CTR data, ensuring alignment with the given descriptions. Rigorously validate the logical connections between expert opinions and CTR content, confirming all assertions are supported by evidence from the CTRs and consistent with the provided descriptions.
----------
4->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis by integrating advanced medical expertise with detailed Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Thoroughly examine the methodologies, results, efficacy, safety profiles, participant selection criteria, trial protocols, outcomes, and documented adverse reactions as presented in the CTRs. Offer precise, expert-level assessments for individual or comparative CTRs, substantiated by CTR data and in strict accordance with the provided descriptions. Ensure rigorous verification of the logical correlations between expert evaluations and CTR content, confirming that all assertions are evidence-based, consistent with the descriptions, and devoid of contradictions.

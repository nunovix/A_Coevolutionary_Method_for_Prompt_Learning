0->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.
----------
1->Your objective is to scrutinize semantic entailment relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements regarding the confidentiality obligations. NDAs specify conditions for handling sensitive information, including its definition, parties' obligations, agreement term, and exclusions. Carefully examine an input statement to determine if its claims about the NDA are substantiated by the descriptions in the agreement, or if they contradict it.
----------
2->Assess semantic entailment between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and related statements, evaluating whether assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions, including scope, usage, duration, exclusions, and other pertinent terms.
----------
3->Consider the challenge of assessing semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements. NDAs outline procedures and obligations for protecting confidential information, including its scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions. Evaluate whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions.
----------
4->Establish semantic entailment relations between key provisions of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and statements regarding the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Specifically, analyze the NDA's definitions of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration, exclusions, and other relevant terms to determine whether a given statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.
----------
5->Evaluate semantic entailment between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements related to the confidentiality obligations they impose. Assess whether the claims made in a statement align with, or contradict, the information covered in a non-disclosure agreement, including the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms.

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic analysis to identify and validate the supportive links between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, verifying the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Confirm entailment by comparing expert statements with the CTR's eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Apply this analytical process to either a single CTR or multiple CTRs, ensuring consistency and non-contradiction with expert clinical assertions.

2->

Perform an exhaustive semantic analysis to discern and authenticate the supportive links between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims, verifying the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Validate entailment by correlating expert statements with the CTR's ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION details, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Execute this analytical process on either a single CTR or multiple CTRs, maintaining consistency and non-contradiction with expert clinical assertions.

Perform an in-depth semantic analysis to discern and confirm the supportive links between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims, verifying the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Validate entailment by correlating expert statements with the CTR's eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, results, and adverse events. Apply this analytical approach to either a single CTR or multiple CTRs, ensuring consistency and non-contradiction with expert clinical assertions.

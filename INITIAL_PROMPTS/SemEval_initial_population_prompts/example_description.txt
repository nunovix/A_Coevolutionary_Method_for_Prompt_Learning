The following example illustrates how to solve the task of assessing semantic entailment, providing an EXAMPLE CTR, an EXAMPLE STATEMENT, and an EXAMPLE ANSWER. 
Consider the following EXAMPLE CTR, EXAMPLE STATEMENT, and EXAMPLE ANSWER. Use the example as a guideline to understand how to approach and solve the task of determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs).
The information given next corresponds to an EXAMPLE CTR, an EXAMPLE STATEMENT, and an EXAMPLE ANSWER. Refer to this example to grasp the reasoning process associated to the task of determining the validity of clinical statements.
Attend to the next example as a demonstration for how semantic entailment should be assessed, noting that the provided example features parts corresponding to EXAMPLE CTR, EXAMPLE STATEMENT, and EXAMPLE ANSWER.
As EXAMPLE CTR, EXAMPLE STATEMENT, and EXAMPLE ANSWER are given next. Use the example as a reference to understand the task and as a demonstration on how to determine the validity of clinical statements.

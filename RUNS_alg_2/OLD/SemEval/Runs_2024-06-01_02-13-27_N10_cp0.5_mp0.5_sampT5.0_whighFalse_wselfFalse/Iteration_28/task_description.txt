0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by analyzing participant eligibility, intervention specifics, result summaries, and adverse event documentation to assess treatment efficacy and safety. Dissect each CTR into four critical components: (1) Eligibility Criteria, specifying participant inclusion/exclusion criteria, (2) Intervention Details, describing the treatment protocol, dosage, administration schedule, and trial length, (3) Results Summary, encapsulating participant data, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and principal findings, and (4) Adverse Event Log, recording clinical symptoms and their incidence rates. Offer precise interpretations and elucidations of clinical statements within a single CTR or across a series of CTRs, ensuring meticulous accuracy and uniformity under expert review.

2->

Perform an in-depth analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treatments, concentrating on the following key aspects: 

1. Patient Selection Criteria: Examine the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection.

2. Treatment Protocol: Analyze the therapeutic approach, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration.

3. Participant Data and Outcome Measures: Summarize participant information, primary and secondary endpoints, measurement units, and study conclusions.

4. Clinical Symptoms and Frequency: Document the clinical symptoms observed and their occurrence rates.

Ensure to provide detailed explanations and clarifications of clinical statements within a single CTR or across multiple CTRs, maintaining precision and consistency under expert review.

Perform an in-depth analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by examining the relationships and clinical statements to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treatments. Break down each CTR into four essential elements: (1) Eligibility Criteria, detailing the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, (2) Intervention, outlining the treatment method, dosage, administration schedule, and duration, (3) Results, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units of measurement, and key findings, and (4) Adverse Events, documenting any clinical symptoms and their frequency. Provide detailed interpretations and clarifications of clinical statements within a single CTR or across multiple CTRs, ensuring accuracy and consistency under expert scrutiny.

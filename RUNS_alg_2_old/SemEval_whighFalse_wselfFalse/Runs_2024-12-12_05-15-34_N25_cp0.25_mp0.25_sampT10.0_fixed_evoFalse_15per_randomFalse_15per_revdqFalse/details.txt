Total elapsed time: 8:45:22.466048
No. of iterations: 26
Average time per iteration: 0:20:12.402540

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 25
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 5
Max no. of iterations allowed: 200
Patience: 10
Evaluation done on: dev set
With 474 examples

Label distribution: Counter({'Contradiction': 237, 'Entailment': 237})

Name of the model used: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
Retrieving examples-->False 
Alg 2 - Random sample 2 individuals weighted on scores, apply crossover and mutation to the offspring, top 5 performers are always kept as elite population
With crossover probability 0.5 and mutation probability 0.5

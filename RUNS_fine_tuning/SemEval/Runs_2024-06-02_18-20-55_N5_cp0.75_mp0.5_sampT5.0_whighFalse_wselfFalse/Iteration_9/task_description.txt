0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis linking segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with expert claims regarding trial protocols, outcomes, therapeutic efficacy, and safety. Dissect CTRs into ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Validate that expert assertions are in agreement with CTR data, are corroborated by the reports, and maintain consistency with the given descriptions.
----------
2->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis correlating sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with assertions made by clinical domain experts. Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions based on the methodologies and results outlined in the CTRs. Compare experts' statements regarding a single CTR or across multiple reports, verifying that these statements align with the CTR data, are supported by the reports, and do not conflict with the given descriptions.
----------
3->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert claims, focusing on protocols, outcomes, therapeutic efficacy, and safety. Break down CTRs into ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (patient inclusion conditions), INTERVENTION (treatment specifics: type, dosage, frequency, duration), RESULTS (participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, findings), and ADVERSE EVENTS (observed signs and symptoms). Confirm that expert claims are consistent with CTR data, supported by the reports, and do not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
4->Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert assertions and detailed segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on trial protocols, outcomes, therapeutic efficacy, and safety. Scrutinize CTRs divided into ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Ensure expert claims are congruent with CTR data, substantiated by the reports, and consistent with the provided descriptions.

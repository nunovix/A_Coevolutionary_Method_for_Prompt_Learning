0->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the validity of clinical statements. CTRs contain four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Determine if statements accurately reflect the content of these sections or compare findings between two CTRs.
----------
1->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify the accuracy of clinical statements. CTRs are structured into four main sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Treatment Protocol, (3) Outcomes, and (4) Adverse Events. Assess the truthfulness of clinical claims by carefully comparing them with the relevant parts of the CTRs, ensuring a thorough and scientifically rigorous evaluation.
----------
2->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to ascertain the accuracy of clinical assertions. CTRs are structured into four critical components: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Assess whether the clinical statements correspond precisely with the information presented in these sections or contrast the outcomes from different CTRs.
----------
3->Scrutinize Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) to confirm the validity of medical assertions. These documents are organized into four key segments: (1) Participant Qualifications, (2) Intervention Details, (3) Results, and (4) Side Effects. Evaluate the veracity of health-related statements by meticulously cross-referencing them with the pertinent sections of the CTDs, guaranteeing a comprehensive and evidence-based assessment.
----------
4->Review Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) to validate medical claims. Break down CTDs into four key sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Treatment Protocol, (3) Observed Results, and (4) Documented Adverse Events. Check for consistency in claims across various CTDs or identify discrepancies.

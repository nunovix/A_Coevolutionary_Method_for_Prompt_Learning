0->Consider the problem of assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements put forth by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements should be supported by the CTR information, not contradicting any of the provided descriptions. In brief, CTRs elucidate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, encompassing four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments from different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS summarizing the participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.

1->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

2->Assess the semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements must be grounded in the CTR information and not contradict any of the provided descriptions. The CTRs comprise four key sections: 

1. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: specifies the conditions for patient inclusion. 
2. INTERVENTION: details treatments from different patient cohorts. 
3. RESULTS: summarizes participant statistics and trial outcomes. 
4. ADVERSE EVENTS: lists observed signs and symptoms. 

Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two CTRs. Ensure that statements are supported by the CTR information and do not contradict any descriptions.

3->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. Determine the support of clinical statements from sections of CTRs, which detail methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising efficacy and safety of new treatments. Assess statements for alignment with CTR information, finding support in specific sections and avoiding contradictions.

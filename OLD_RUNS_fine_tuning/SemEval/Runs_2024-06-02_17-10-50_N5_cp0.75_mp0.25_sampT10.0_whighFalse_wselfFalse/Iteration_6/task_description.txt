0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Execute a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis on Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), dissecting them into Eligibility Criteria, Intervention Details, Results Summary, and Adverse Events Documentation. Ensure each segment adheres to domain-specific clinical terminology, is evidence-based, and aligns with the provided descriptions. Verify the semantic relationships or supports focusing on methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions. Confirm the alignment of these segments with domain-specific clinical assertions regarding methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions, substantiated by the CTRs.
----------
2->

Conduct a detailed semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions, focusing on patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, and duration), results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and adverse events (observed signs and symptoms). Validate the congruence of these elements with expert claims, ensuring consistency with CTR content, evidence-based substantiation, and adherence to provided descriptions for a comprehensive comparative evaluation.
----------
3->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment or support analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions, scrutinizing patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, and duration), results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and adverse events (observed signs and symptoms). Verify the alignment of these elements with expert claims, ensuring consistency with CTR content, evidence-based justification, and strict adherence to provided descriptions for a comprehensive comparative evaluation.

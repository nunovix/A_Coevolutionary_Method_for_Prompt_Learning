0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->"Evaluate semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements. CTRs detail clinical trial methodologies and outcomes, assessing new treatment efficacy and safety. Expert statements claim information from specific CTR sections, either for a single report or in comparative analyses. Validate entailment by ensuring statements align with CTR information, find support within the report, and do not contradict provided descriptions."

2->

Identify and elucidate the supportive associations between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical assertions. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and results of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Break down CTRs into four primary components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient enrollment; (2) INTERVENTION, outlining the specific type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration; (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and conclusions; (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Analyze and substantiate clinical claims pertaining to individual CTRs or comparative analyses between them.

3->"Analyze the semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, focusing on methodology, findings, eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Each CTR, involving 1-2 patient cohorts, assesses new treatments' effectiveness and safety. CTRs are divided into four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA detailing patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION outlining treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant numbers, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS documenting observed signs and symptoms. Expert statements should be related to, supported by, and non-contradictory to the CTR sections. Establish entailment by ensuring the statement's claim aligns with the CTR information, is substantiated by the report, and adheres to the provided descriptions."

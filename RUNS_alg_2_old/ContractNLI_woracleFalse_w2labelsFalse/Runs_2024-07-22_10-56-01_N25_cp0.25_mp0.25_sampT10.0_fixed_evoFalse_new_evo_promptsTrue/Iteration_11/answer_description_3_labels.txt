0->You MUST respond with either YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED, to indicate whether it is possible to state that the statement is valid based on the information provided in the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). For the answer to be YES, the statement must be fully supported by the NDA. An answer of NOT MENTIONED means that the information in the statement is not referenced in the NDA.
----------
1-> Determine the validity of the statement regarding the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) by responding with YES if the statement is fully supported by the NDA, NO if it is not, or NOT MENTIONED if the information in the statement is not referenced in the NDA. 
----------
2->Determine if the statement can be validated as YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED according to the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) contents. A YES response requires full NDA support, while NOT MENTIONED indicates the statement lacks NDA reference.
----------
3->Evaluate the content of the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to determine if the statement in question is substantiated by the agreement's provisions. Provide a response in the form of YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED, reflecting the presence or absence of relevant information within the NDA. A response of YES signifies that the statement is fully corroborated by the NDA. Conversely, a response of NOT MENTIONED indicates that the statement lacks any reference in the NDA.

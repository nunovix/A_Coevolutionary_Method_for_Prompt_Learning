0->Consider the task of writing a clinical note summarizing a conversation between a doctor and patient. The note should be structured into 4 sections: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, PHYSICAL EXAM, RESULTS, ASSESSMENT AND PLAN. Be as accurate as possible in the summarization, attending to clinical concepts that are identified as present or absent in the transcription of the conversation.
----------
1->Compose a healthcare note that encapsulates all the relevant information in a verbal exchange between a doctor and a patient. Adhere to standard recommendations for structuring clinical notes, considering parts such as the History of the Present Illness (HPI), a Review of Systems (ROS), conclusions from a Physical Examination (PE), lab and imaging results, and other relevant tests, and finally the doctor's Assessment and treatment Plan (A/P). As a way to aid you in the wrtiting of the note, you'll also be provided with an example note. Use it as a way to know the proper structure you should use.

2->Your task concerns summarizing the transcript of a dialogue between a doctor and a patient, collected in the context of a clinical encounter. Start by briefly describing the main presenting issues, and then organize the relevant elements expressed in the conversation clearly and consistently. Be sure to describe the patient’s chief complaints, including onset, chronology, quality, and severity, taking as basis what the patient tells to the doctor about how he feels and what happened. Register also the measurable and objective facts about the patient’s status, such as vital signs or other findings, as observed by the doctor. Include the doctor's interpretation, in the form of complete list of diagnoses together with additional relevant attributes. Finally, document the treatment plan, including further investigations deemed necessary, referral procedures, new medications, or other prescribed therapies.
----------
3->Create a comprehensive medical note based on a recorded conversation between a healthcare provider and patient. Focus on capturing essential details, including medications, diagnoses, and treatment plans. Use a standardized format, such as the SOAP or APSO model, to organize your note. Ensure clarity, concision, and accuracy in your writing. An example note will be provided to guide your structure and content.
----------
4->Summarize the key points from a doctor-patient conversation. Begin by outlining the patient's main symptoms and concerns. Then, organize the conversation into a clear and logical structure, highlighting the patient's self-reported experiences and the doctor's observations. Be sure to note the patient's vital signs and any notable findings. The doctor's diagnosis and treatment plan should also be clearly documented, including any necessary tests, referrals, or medications.
----------
5->You are tasked with creating a clinical note from the transcription of a dialogue between a physician and a patient. Your summary should capture the essence of the conversation, organizing the information into sections. Begin by documenting the patient's main complaint and the relevant medical history. Next, present objective and measurable findings, followed by the doctor's assessment of the information given by the patient, and the corresponding diagnosis. Finally, present the strategy for medication management, and outline the follow-up plan for patient monitoring.

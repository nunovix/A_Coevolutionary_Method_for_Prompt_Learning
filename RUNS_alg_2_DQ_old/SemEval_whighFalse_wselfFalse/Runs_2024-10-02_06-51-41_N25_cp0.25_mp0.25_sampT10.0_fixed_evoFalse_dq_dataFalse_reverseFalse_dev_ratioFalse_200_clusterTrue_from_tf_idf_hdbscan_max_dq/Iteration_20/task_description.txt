0->Assess the logical consistency between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert opinions in the medical field. CTRs outline the procedures and results of medical studies, evaluating new therapies' effectiveness and safety. Conversely, expert opinions articulate assertions about particular CTR sections or compare two CTRs. To confirm logical consistency, the expert's assertion must be corroborated by the CTR data and not oppose any given details.
----------
1->Assess the logical consistency and semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements from clinical domain experts. CTRs provide detailed methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, evaluating new treatments' efficacy and safety. Expert statements may make claims about specific CTR sections or conduct comparative analyses of two CTRs. Validate the expert's claims by ensuring they are substantiated by the CTR data, align with the presented information, and do not contradict any details. Confirm that expert assertions are supported by the CTRs and that comparative analyses between two CTRs are logically coherent and semantically consistent.
----------
2->Assess the consistency between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert medical opinions. CTRs record the procedures and results of medical research, assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Conversely, medical opinions provide perspectives on certain CTR sections or compare results from various CTRs. Consistency is achieved when opinions are in harmony with the CTR content and do not refute any stated facts.

A Clinical Trial Report (CTR) is organized into six key sections: Background and Objectives, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References. (Standard CTR structures prescribe this format.)
----------
2->
CTRs include the following descriptions:

1. Study Design: The experimental design and methodology of the clinical trial.
2. Patient Population: The demographic and baseline characteristics of the study participants.
3. Interventions: The type, dosage, and duration of the treatments or procedures administered to the patients.
4. Outcome Measures: The methods used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the interventions.
5. Results: The statistical analysis and interpretation of the data obtained from the trial.
6. Conclusion: The summary of the main findings and their implications for clinical practice.

The Clinical Trial Report (CTR) comprises three key elements:

1. Background: details the study background, objectives, methods, and participant information.
2. Intervention: describes the experimental treatment or procedure being tested.
3. Outcomes: outlines the primary and secondary endpoints, along with the statistical analysis methods for evaluating them.

(Excluded: "Results and Discussion" and "Conclusion" sections, typically presented separately in scientific publications, and the "References" section, not directly related to the CTR.)

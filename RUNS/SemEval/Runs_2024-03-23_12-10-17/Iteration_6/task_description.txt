The objective is to evaluate semantic entailment between statements made by clinical domain experts and sections in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). To establish entailment, a statement's assertion must be supported by the CTR and should not contradict provided descriptions. CTRs provide detailed information on clinical trial procedures, outcomes, efficacy, and safety of emerging treatments. A comprehensive CTR consists of four main sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria outlining patient inclusion conditions, (2) Intervention detailing treatment specifics including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Results summarizing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) Adverse Events listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements propose claims regarding the information within these CTR sections for a single report or comparative analyses. For entailment, a statement's assertion must align with clinical trial data and be substantiated by the CTR.

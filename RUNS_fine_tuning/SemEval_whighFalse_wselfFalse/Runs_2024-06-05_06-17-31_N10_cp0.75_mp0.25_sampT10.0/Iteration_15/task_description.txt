0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Perform an in-depth semantic analysis correlating segments within Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical documents to verify therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Align findings with expert claims on eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse event documentation in both individual and comparative CTR analyses. Ensure logical coherence, non-contradiction, and consistency with expert clinical assertions regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse events.

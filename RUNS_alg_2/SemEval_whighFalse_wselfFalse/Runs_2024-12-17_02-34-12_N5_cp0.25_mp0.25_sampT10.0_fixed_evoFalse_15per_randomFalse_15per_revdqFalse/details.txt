Total elapsed time: 0:07:15.444484
No. of iterations: 1
Average time per iteration: 0:07:15.444484

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 5
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 1
Max no. of iterations allowed: 2
Patience: 1
Evaluation done on: dev set
With 284 examples

Label distribution: Counter({'Contradiction': 142, 'Entailment': 142})

Name of the model used: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
Retrieving examples-->False 
Alg 2 - Random sample 2 individuals weighted on scores, apply crossover and mutation to the offspring, top 1 performers are always kept as elite population
With crossover probability 0.5 and mutation probability 0.5

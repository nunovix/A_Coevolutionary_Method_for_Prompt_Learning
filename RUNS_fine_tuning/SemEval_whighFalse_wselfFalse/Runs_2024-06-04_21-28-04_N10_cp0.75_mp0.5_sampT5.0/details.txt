Total elapsed time: 7:33:01.261099
No. of iterations: 30
Average time per iteration: 0:15:06.042037

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 10
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 1
Max no. of iterations allowed: 200
Patience: 30
Evaluation done on: dev set
With 200 examples

Name of the model used: microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
Retrieving examples-->False 
Alg 2 - Random sample 2 individuals weighted on scores, apply crossover and mutation to the offspring, top 1 performers are always kept as elite population
With crossover probability 0.75 and mutation probability 0.5

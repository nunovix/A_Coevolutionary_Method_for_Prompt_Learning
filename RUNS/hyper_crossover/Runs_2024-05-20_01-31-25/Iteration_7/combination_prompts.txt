0->Consider the problem of combining two different textual instructions, pertaining to the same task. The objective is to rephrase the main information common to the two descriptions, while keeping their meaning and intent. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The combined instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The combined instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instructions. Considering the aforementioned task description, combine the two textual instructions shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.

2->Create an advanced, specialist-grade manual that synthesizes the overarching concept and key points from the first two directives. This manual must maintain the primary objective, essential information, and necessary precision, exceeding the clarity and complexity of the originals. Designed for expert readers, it should ensure pinpoint accuracy and either succinctly summarize or detail the principal task with greater instructional clarity.
----------
3->Rephrase and consolidate the main elements of two expert-level textual instructions related to the same task, ensuring the essence and purpose are preserved. The revised instruction should either succinctly encapsulate key points with precision or be extended for detailed clarifications and definitions. Focus on accuracy, as incorrect information will result in penalties. Aim for clarity that surpasses both original instructions.


Combining INSTRUCTION 1 and INSTRUCTION 2:

Revise and synthesize two expert-level instructions on a unified task. Maintain the core intent and meaning, while clarifying and, if necessary, extending the instructions with expert-level definitions for precision. Ensure brevity and accuracy to avoid penalties, with the goal to surpass the clarity of the original instructions.
----------
4->Develop a sophisticated guide for professionals that integrates concise and detailed instructions for executing a common operation, ensuring it retains the original purpose, key details, and heightens clarity and accuracy over the base instructions.

0->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the validity of clinical statements. CTRs contain four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Determine if statements accurately reflect the content of these sections or compare findings between two CTRs.
----------
1->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify the accuracy of clinical statements. CTRs are structured into four main sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Treatment Protocol, (3) Outcomes, and (4) Adverse Events. Assess the truthfulness of clinical claims by carefully comparing them with the relevant parts of the CTRs, ensuring a thorough and scientifically rigorous evaluation.
----------
2->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to validate clinical statements. CTRs are divided into four main sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Confirm if the clinical statements align with the information in these sections or identify inconsistencies when comparing two CTRs.
----------
3->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to assess the accuracy of clinical claims. CTRs are structured into four main parts: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Verify that statements correspond with these sections or contrast data from different CTRs.
----------
4->Examine Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) to assess the accuracy of medical assertions. These documents are divided into four main parts: (1) Participant Eligibility, (2) Treatment Administered, (3) Outcomes Observed, and (4) Side Effects Recorded. Verify whether the claims are consistent with the information in these segments or contrast data from different CTDs.

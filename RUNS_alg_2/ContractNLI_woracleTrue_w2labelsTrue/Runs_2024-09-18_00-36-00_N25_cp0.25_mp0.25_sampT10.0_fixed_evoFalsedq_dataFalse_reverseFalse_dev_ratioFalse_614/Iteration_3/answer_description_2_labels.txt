RESULT: 

The rephrased instruction maintains the essence of the original task, which is to determine the truthfulness of a statement. By using "Evaluate the correctness" instead of "Assess the accuracy," the instruction becomes more direct and focused on the specific action of verifying the statement's validity. The term "given statement" clearly identifies the subject of the evaluation, ensuring that there is no ambiguity about what needs to be assessed.

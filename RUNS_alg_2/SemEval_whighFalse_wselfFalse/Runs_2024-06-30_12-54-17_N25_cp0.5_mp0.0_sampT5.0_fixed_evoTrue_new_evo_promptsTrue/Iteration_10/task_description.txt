0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.

3->Evaluate the semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements, focusing on CTR sections's CTRs sections, and expert claims are coherent and consistent with the clinical trial methodologies and outcomes, without contradicting the provided descriptions. Focus on key sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Confirm the effectiveness and safety of new treatments by analyzing these sections in relation to the overall methodology and outcomes. Conduct a comparative analysis of two CTRs to establish semantic entailment between their sections and expert statements.

0->Your task is to evaluate the validity of clinical statements by examining specific components of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs provide detailed information about clinical trials, including the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. These reports are divided into four main sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Statements in CTRs make assertions about the data in these sections, either for a single report or for comparisons between multiple reports.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Assess the semantic entailment between discrete segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical specialists. CTRs detail the procedures and results of clinical trials, evaluating the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. The assertions, conversely, make claims regarding specific sections of CTRs, either for a single report or for a comparative analysis between two. For entailment verification, ensure that the claim is consistent with the clinical trial data, is substantiated by the CTR, and does not conflict with the given descriptions.
----------
2->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between expert claims and detailed sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Conduct both individual and comparative analyses to confirm that expert assertions are congruent with clinical trial data, substantiated by pertinent excerpts from CTRs. Ensure that these findings are consistent with the original claims and devoid of contradictions.
----------
3->

Conduct a semantic entailment analysis between expert claims and detailed segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), scrutinizing ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS for both individual and comparative evaluations. Ensure expert assertions are corroborated by pertinent CTR excerpts, align with preliminary descriptions, and maintain consistency without contradictions.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->Your objective is to analyze semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-articulated statements. CTRs provide details on clinical trial procedures and findings, evaluating the effectiveness and safety of innovative treatments. Each CTR includes cohorts with distinct treatments or baseline characteristics. Comprehensive CTRs are divided into four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA outlining conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION specifics detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summary presenting participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements made by clinical experts should align with data from these sections, be substantiated by the CTR, and remain consistent with the provided descriptions to establish entailment.

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to ascertain semantic entailment relationships with expert clinical statements. Evaluate new treatments' effectiveness and safety based on CTRs' methodology and findings. Break down analysis into four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION, describing treatment specifics including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms. Ensure expert statements corroborate, rather than contradict, data from these sections for individual or comparative CTR analyses.

3->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical specialists. CTRs detail the procedures and results of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. The assertions, conversely, make specific claims about information contained within sections of a single CTR or between two CTRs for comparative analysis. To validate entailment, ensure that the claim is consistent with the clinical trial data, is substantiated by the CTR, and does not conflict with the given descriptions.

4->

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to discern semantic entailment relationships with expert clinical statements. Evaluate new treatments' effectiveness and safety across four main CTR sections: (1) Patient eligibility criteria, (2) Treatment specifics including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Summary of participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) Recorded adverse events detailing observed signs and symptoms. Verify that expert clinical statements are congruent with, and supported by, the information in these CTR sections for individual reports or comparative analyses between reports.

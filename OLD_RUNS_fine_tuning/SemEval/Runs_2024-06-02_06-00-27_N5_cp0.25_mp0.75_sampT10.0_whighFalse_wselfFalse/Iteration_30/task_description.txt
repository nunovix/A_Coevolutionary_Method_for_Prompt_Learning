0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->

Critically evaluate Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to determine the efficacy and safety profiles of novel therapeutics. Dissect each CTR into four principal elements: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (patient inclusion conditions), INTERVENTION (treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration), RESULTS (participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and ADVERSE EVENTS (observed signs and symptoms). Validate clinical assertions pertaining to individual CTRs or comparative analyses.

2->

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Break down CTRs into four key components: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (patient inclusion conditions), INTERVENTION (treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration), RESULTS (participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and ADVERSE EVENTS (observed signs and symptoms). Examine and substantiate clinical claims related to individual CTRs or comparative analyses.

3->

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to assess the therapeutic interventions' effectiveness and safety. Dissect CTRs into four key elements: (1) Eligibility Criteria, outlining patient inclusion conditions, (2) Therapeutic Intervention Details, specifying treatment type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) Participant Outcomes, detailing participant data, outcome measures, units of measurement, and results, and (4) Adverse Event Documentation, recording any observed adverse signs and symptoms. Evaluate clinical statements that either corroborate a single CTR or compare two.

4->

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles of new drugs. Break down CTRs into four key components: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (patient inclusion conditions), INTERVENTION (treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration), RESULTS (participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and ADVERSE EVENTS (observed signs and symptoms). Confirm clinical claims related to individual CTRs or comparative analyses.

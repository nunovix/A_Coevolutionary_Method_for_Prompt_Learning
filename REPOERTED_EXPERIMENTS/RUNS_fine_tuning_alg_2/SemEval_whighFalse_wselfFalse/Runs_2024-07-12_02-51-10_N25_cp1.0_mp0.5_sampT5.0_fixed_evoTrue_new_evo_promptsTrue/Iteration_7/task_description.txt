0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Analyze clinical trial reports (CTRs), which are divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Determine if expert statements about these sections are semantically entailed by the CTRs, ensuring no contradictions are present.
----------
2->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify if expert commentary on eligibility criteria, intervention details, results, and adverse events aligns with the content, ensuring consistency and absence of contradictions.
----------
3->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for expert commentary on (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events, ensuring there are no inconsistencies.
----------
4->Review Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for semantic consistency in Expert Commentary on Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events, avoiding contradictions.
----------
5->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify the semantic consistency of Expert Commentary on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS, ensuring no contradictions are present.

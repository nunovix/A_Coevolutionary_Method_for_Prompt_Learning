0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Analyze and validate clinical statements derived from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs provide comprehensive insights into clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutics. The CTRs are divided into four distinct sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining eligibility criteria for patient participation; (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the intervention's type, dosage, frequency, and duration; (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions; and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any unexpected adverse events. Formulate statements based on these sections, either pertaining to a single CTR or contrasting two CTRs.

2->Evaluate and authenticate clinical assertions extracted from individual Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), which offer comprehensive insights into clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of innovative treatments. CTRs are segmented into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, specifying the criteria for patient eligibility; (2) INTERVENTION, describing the intervention's type, dosage, frequency, and duration; (3) RESULTS, detailing participant information, outcome measures, units, and conclusions; and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, recording any unforeseen adverse events. Develop statements based on these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.
----------
3->Perform a detailed examination of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to extract and verify clinical assertions, ensuring semantic consistency throughout the document and congruence with expert perspects. Divide CTRs into ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Derive logically inferred expert claims from the CTR content, supported by the reports, and maintain coherence among them. For each CTR, create comprehensive statements summarizing the key elements of ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS, while aligning with expert claims and preventing contradictions.
----------
4->Analyze and validate clinical claims derived from segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), which provide detailed insights into clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapies. CTRs are divided into four primary sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, outlining the requirements for patient selection; (2) Intervention, detailing the intervention's type, dosage, frequency, and duration; (3) Results, presenting participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions; and (4) Adverse Events, documenting any unexpected adverse events. Formulate statements based on these sections, either for a single CTR or for comparative analysis between two CTRs.

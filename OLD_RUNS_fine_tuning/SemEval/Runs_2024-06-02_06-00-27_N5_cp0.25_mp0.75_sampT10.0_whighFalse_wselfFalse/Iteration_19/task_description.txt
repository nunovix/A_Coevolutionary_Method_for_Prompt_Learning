0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by systematically breaking them down into four key components: (1) Eligibility Criteria, outlining participant inclusion and exclusion criteria, (2) Intervention, detailing the type of treatment, dosage, frequency, and treatment duration, (3) Results, describing participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) Adverse Events, documenting any observed signs and symptoms. Critically assess and validate clinical assertions using these components for individual CTRs or in comparative analyses between different CTRs.

Dissect Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) into four key components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, specifying inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, providing participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Analyze and validate clinical claims based on these components for individual CTRs or in comparative analyses.

3->

Systematically dissect Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) into four core elements: (1) Eligibility Criteria, encompassing inclusion and exclusion criteria for participant selection, (2) Intervention, detailing the specifics of the treatment including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Results, covering participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) Adverse Events, documenting any observed signs and symptoms. Apply these elements to validate clinical claims for individual CTRs or when performing comparative analyses between CTRs.

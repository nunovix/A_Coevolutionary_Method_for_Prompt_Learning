Consider the task of summarizing messenger-like conversations between two or more individuals. The conversations reflect the typical topics that would appear in regular real-life daily exchanges, although the style and register can differ. The summaries should be concise briefs of what people talked about, presenting the important pieces of information in the third person. Use short sentences to summarize specific information, separating different topics into separate sentences.
You are tasked with summarizing natural messenger-like conversations, presented in a format where colons separate the author of an utterance from its content, and each utterance is shown in a separate line. Your summaries should (1) be very short, (2) capture the important pieces of information, (3) include the names of the interlocutors, and (4) be written in the third person. You should check that the summary accurately reflects the original content and captures the essence of the discussion, while using fifty words or less.
You need to compose a very short summary that encapsulates all the relevant information in a verbal exchange between two or more individuals. The conversation that is to be summarized is similar to those typically written via messenger apps, which can include chit-chat, gossiping about friends, arranging meetings, discussing politics, consulting assignments with colleagues, etc. The summary should be written in the third person, clearly stating the names of interlocutors. It is important to use very concise language to summarize the main points, avoiding any unnecessary details or repetition. Organize the summary in short sentences to summarize different topics.
Your task concerns summarizing a messenger-like conversation into 50 words or less, noting that the most important pieces of information can be scattered across the utterances of different speakers. Notice that natural conversions can shorten words, use slang phrases, or even feature typos, but your summary should describe the essence of the conversation in clear and concise language, including the names of the speakers and using the third-person point of view. An ideal summary should contain short sentences, each encapsulating a distinct piece of information from the conversation.

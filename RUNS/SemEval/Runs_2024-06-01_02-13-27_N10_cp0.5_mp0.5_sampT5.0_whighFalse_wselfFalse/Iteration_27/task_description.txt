0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Perform a comprehensive examination of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treatments. Break down the analysis into four key areas: (1) Participant Selection Criteria, detailing inclusion and exclusion criteria, (2) Treatment Protocol, specifying the therapeutic approach, dosage details, administration schedule, and treatment duration, (3) Clinical Outcomes, summarizing participant data, primary and secondary endpoints, measurement units, and results, and (4) Adverse Reactions, recording clinical symptoms and their frequency. Offer thorough explanations and clarifications of clinical results from a single CTR or multiple CTRs, maintaining precision and uniformity under expert scrutiny.

2->

Perform an in-depth analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by examining the relationships and clinical statements to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treatments. Break down each CTR into four essential elements: (1) Eligibility Criteria, detailing the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, (2) Intervention, outlining the treatment method, dosage, administration schedule, and duration, (3) Results, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units of measurement, and key findings, and (4) Adverse Events, documenting any clinical symptoms and their frequency. Provide detailed interpretations and clarifications of clinical statements within a single CTR or across multiple CTRs, ensuring accuracy and consistency under expert scrutiny.

3->

Conduct an in-depth analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on the interrelation of sections and clinical assertions to assess therapeutic effectiveness and safety. Dissect CTRs into four principal elements: (1) Eligibility Criteria, specifying inclusion and exclusion parameters for patient selection, (2) Intervention, detailing the therapeutic approach, dosage regimen, administration protocol, and treatment length, (3) Results, encapsulating participant data, endpoints, measurement units, and study findings, and (4) Adverse Events, recording clinical symptoms and their incidence rates. Offer detailed examinations and elucidations of clinical statements within a single CTR or across a series of CTRs, ensuring accuracy and consistency under expert review.
----------
4->

Perform an expert-level analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), dissecting the connections between sections and clinical assertions to assess therapeutic effectiveness and safety. Break down CTRs into four principal components: (1) INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA, detailing patient selection parameters, (2) THERAPEUTIC APPROACH, outlining the treatment methodology, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment length, (3) PARTICIPANT DATA AND OUTCOME MEASURES, summarizing participant information, result indicators, measurement units, and study conclusions, and (4) CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND FREQUENCY, documenting observed clinical symptoms and their occurrence rates. Provide comprehensive elucidations and clarifications of clinical statements within a single CTR or across multiple CTRs, ensuring precision and uniformity under expert scrutiny.

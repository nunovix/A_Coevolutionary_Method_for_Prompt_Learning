0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Assess the accuracy of health-related assertions derived from specific sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). These reports detail the methodology and findings of trials evaluating new medical treatments' effectiveness and safety. Typically, a CTR is segmented into four main parts: (1) Eligibility Criteria for Participants, (2) Treatment Protocol, (3) Summary of Findings, and (4) Documentation of Adverse Events. Verify the claims made about the information in these sections, either individually or when comparing two CTRs.

2->Assess the accuracy of clinical statements by cross-referencing with the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections of various Clinical Trial Reports.
----------
3->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify the accuracy of statements regarding eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events.

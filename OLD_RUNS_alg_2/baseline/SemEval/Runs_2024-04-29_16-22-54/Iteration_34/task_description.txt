Align clinical experts' statements with corresponding sections in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Reconcile any discrepancies between professionals' assertions and CTR data. CTRs provide comprehensive and detailed information on clinical trial protocols, outcomes, and safety and efficacy assessments. Key elements of CTRs include:

1. Patient Eligibility: Clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria
2. Procedural Details: Detailed intervention descriptions, including dosage, administration methods, and duration
3. Assessment Data: Extensive patient information, diagnostic procedures, and trial findings
4. Adverse Reactions: Documented instances of adverse events and related symptoms.

Clinical experts can examine individual CTRs or multiple reports for thorough evaluation.

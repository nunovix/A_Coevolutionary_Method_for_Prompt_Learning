0->"To enhance AI system performance when reworking written guidance, follow these steps:

1. Identify key elements, taking into account temporal and negation contexts.
2. Revise the instruction for clear and concise expression.
3. Verify that the revised language is precise, actionable, and free from ambiguity.
4. Incorporate relevant details to facilitate smooth implementation.
5. Review the revised instruction to ensure it conveys the intended meaning and achieves the desired outcome."

Note: I made the following changes to the original instruction:

* Simplified the language and rephrased some sentences for better clarity
* Changed "Extract" to "Identify" to make the language more concise
* Changed "Reframe" to "Revise" to use a more active and descriptive verb
* Changed "Ensure" to "Verify" to use a more direct and assertive verb
* Changed "Add" to "Incorporate" to use a more formal and technical term
* Changed "Validate" to "Review" to use a more general term that still conveys the importance of checking the revised instruction.

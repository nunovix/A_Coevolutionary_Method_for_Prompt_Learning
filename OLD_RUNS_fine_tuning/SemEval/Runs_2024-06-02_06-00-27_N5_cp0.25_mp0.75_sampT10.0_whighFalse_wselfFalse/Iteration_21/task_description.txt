0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

Methodically break down Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) into four fundamental components: (1) Eligibility Criteria, which includes the criteria for participant inclusion and exclusion, (2) Intervention, specifying the treatment particulars such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Results, detailing participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) Adverse Events, recording any observed signs and symptoms. Utilize these components to substantiate clinical assertions for individual CTRs or during comparative analyses between CTRs.

Methodically deconstruct Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) into four essential elements: (1) Eligibility Criteria, outlining participant inclusion and exclusion parameters, (2) Intervention, detailing the type of treatment, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment length, (3) Results, summarizing participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and findings, and (4) Adverse Events, noting any observed signs and symptoms. Confirm clinical claims by examining these elements in isolation for individual CTRs or in comparative analyses across multiple CTRs.

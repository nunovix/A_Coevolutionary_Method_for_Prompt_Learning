0->Consider the problem of re-writing a textual instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the description while keeping the exact same meaning. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The re-written instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The re-written instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instruction.
----------
1->Think about the task of rephrasing a written instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the description while slightly changing the meaning. You should re-write the sentence with different words and feel free to add information that might give a better undestanding of the task.
----------
2->Examine the issue of modifying a written command. Rewrite it in a way that would improve the performance of an AI system like yourself when dealing with the given task. So, rewrite the textual instruction shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.
----------
3->

Craft a revised version of a written directive, aiming to articulate the description with altered wording while preserving the original intent. Ensure the rephrased instruction is precise, concise, and tailored for an audience well-versed in the subject matter. Enhance clarity by incorporating definitions and additional explanations where beneficial for comprehension. Avoid introducing inaccuracies.
----------
4->

Refine the provided directive to enhance its execution by an Artificial Intelligence, maintaining clarity and fidelity to the original directive's intent and content.
----------
5->

Reformulate the ensuing textual directive, preserving its fundamental essence, for an audience of field experts. Craft either a distilled rendition that encapsulates the key elements aligned with the original purpose, or an elucidated version incorporating definitions and additional explanations to bolster clarity. Erroneous content will result in penalties. Aim for brevity, directness, and superior clarity in conveying the task compared to the initial directive.
----------
6->

Optimize the given directive for an Artificial Intelligence's task execution, ensuring the preservation of the original directive's intent and meaning.
----------
7->

Reformulate the provided directive into a version that maintains its original intent, tailored for a specialist readership. Choose between a condensed form that distills principal concepts consistent with the initial objective, or an expanded version that integrates definitions and further explanations to improve clarity. Any inaccuracies will incur penalties. The reformulated directive should be clear, to the point, and offer a more lucid comprehension of the task than the initial directive.

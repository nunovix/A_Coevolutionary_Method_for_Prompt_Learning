Total elapsed time: 12:45:15.044026
No. of iterations: 10
Average time per iteration: 1:16:31.504403

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 20
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 5
Max no. of iterations allowed: 200
Patience: 10
Decoder temperature in mutation and combiantions: 1.0
Top-p in sampling for mutation and combiantions: 0.8

Evaluation done on: dev set
With 614 examples

Name of the model used: mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
ORACLE SPANS 
Alg 2 - Random sample 2 individuals weighted on scores, apply crossover and mutation to the offspring, top 5 performers are always kept as elite population

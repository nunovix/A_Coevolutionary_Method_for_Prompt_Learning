0->Consider the problem of assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements put forth by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, the statement's assertion should be supported from the CTR, not contradicting the provided descriptions. In brief, CTRs elucidate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of emerging treatments. Complete CTRs encompass four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION details on the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summarizing the participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements advance claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or in a comparative analysis of two CTRs.

Identify and elucidate the supportive associations between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical assertions. Analyze CTRs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Break down CTRs into four key components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, specifying treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Clinical assertions may pertain to a single CTR or draw comparisons between two.

2->"Your objective is to discern semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements made by domain experts. The entailment is established when a statement's claim is corroborated by the CTR, without contradicting expert descriptions. CTRs detail clinical trials' methodologies and findings, assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Comprising four sections, CTRs include: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA outlining patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements claim information within these sections for a single CTR or in comparative analyses between two CTRs."

3->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

4->

Determine the semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-level clinical statements. CTRs provide comprehensive details on clinical trial methodologies and findings, evaluating new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Analyze four key CTR sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines patient participation conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms. Expert statements should support, not contradict, these sections, either for a single CTR or in comparative analyses between two CTRs.

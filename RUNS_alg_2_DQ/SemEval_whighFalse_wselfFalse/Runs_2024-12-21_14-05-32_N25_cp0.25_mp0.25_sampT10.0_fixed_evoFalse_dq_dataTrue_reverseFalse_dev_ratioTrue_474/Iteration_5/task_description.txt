0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. Assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of CTRs and statements made by clinical domain experts involves verifying that these statements align with the provided CTR information, without contradicting any descriptions. This process requires verifying that statements align with the information within the four key sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two CTRs.

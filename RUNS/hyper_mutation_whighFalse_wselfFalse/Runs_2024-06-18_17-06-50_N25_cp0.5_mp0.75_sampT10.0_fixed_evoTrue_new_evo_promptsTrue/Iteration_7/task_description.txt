0->Consider the problem of re-writing a textual instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the description while keeping the exact same meaning. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The re-written instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The re-written instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instruction.
----------
1->Think about the task of rephrasing a written instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the description while slightly changing the meaning. You should re-write the sentence with different words and feel free to add information that might give a better undestanding of the task.
----------
2->Examine the issue of modifying a written command. Rewrite it in a way that would improve the performance of an AI system like yourself when dealing with the given task. So, rewrite the textual instruction shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.
----------
3->

Revise the provided textual directive to enhance an advanced AI's comprehension and execution of the task at hand. Ensure the rephrased instruction maintains identical meaning as the original. 

REWRITTEN INSTRUCTION: 

Refine the given textual directive to optimize an Artificial Intelligence's task performance, preserving the original directive's intent.

4->

Revise the provided textual directive to enhance an advanced AI's comprehension and execution of the task at hand. Ensure the rephrased instruction maintains identical intent and information as the original.


RESULTING INSTRUCTION: 

Refine the given textual directive to optimize an AI's task performance, preserving the original directive's intent and information.
----------
5->

Craft an expert-level directive that synthesizes the core components of the initial instructions, ensuring clarity, precision, and strict adherence to the original intent. This directive should be articulated either as a concise yet comprehensive summary or as an elaborate, detailed guide, including explicit definitions and clarifications, while meticulously avoiding any inaccuracies.
----------
6->

Rewrite a given textual directive to preserve its original meaning, targeting an expert audience. Opt for either a succinct version that encapsulates key elements in alignment with the initial purpose, or an extended rendition that incorporates definitions and additional elucidations for enhanced clarity. Erroneous details will result in penalties. Ensure the revised directive is succinct, direct, and facilitates a more transparent understanding of the task than the original.
----------
7->

Transform the provided directives into a singular, expert-level directive that retains the fundamental principles of both originals, ensuring enhanced clarity, precision, and unwavering fidelity to the original purpose. The directive may be succinctly condensed or meticulously elaborated with detailed definitions and explanations to augment comprehension, while rigorously prohibiting any inaccuracies.

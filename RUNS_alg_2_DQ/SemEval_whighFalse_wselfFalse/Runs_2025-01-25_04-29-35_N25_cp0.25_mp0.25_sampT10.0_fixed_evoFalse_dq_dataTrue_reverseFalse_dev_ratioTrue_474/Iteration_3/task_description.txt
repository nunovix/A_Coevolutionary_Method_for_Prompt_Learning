0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Consider the problem of assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements put forth by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements should be supported by the CTR information, not contradicting any of the provided descriptions. In brief, CTRs elucidate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, encompassing four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments from different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS summarizing the participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.
----------
2->Examine semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements articulated by clinical domain experts. CTRs assess treatment effectiveness and safety by detailing procedures and findings for cohorts of patients exposed to distinct treatments or exhibiting diverse baseline characteristics. The four main sections of CTRs are: 

- ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: outlines patient inclusion criteria 
- INTERVENTION: describes the treatments administered 
- RESULTS: summarizes participant statistics and trial outcomes 
- ADVERSE EVENTS: documents relevant observations 

Statements make claims about clinical information within these sections, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two CTRs. To establish entailment, evaluate if these statements align with the trial data, avoiding contradictions with the CTRs.
----------
3->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. Assess the alignment of these statements with the methodology and outcomes described in the four main sections of CTRs: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Verify that statements support the information within these sections and do not contradict any descriptions.
----------
4->Assess the semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements must be grounded in the CTR information and not contradict any of the provided descriptions. The CTRs comprise four key sections: 

1. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: outlines the conditions for patient inclusion. 
2. INTERVENTION: describes treatments from different patient cohorts. 
3. RESULTS: summarizes participant statistics and trial outcomes. 
4. ADVERSE EVENTS: lists observed signs and symptoms. 

Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two CTRs.
----------
5->Analyze individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) - ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS - to support clinical statements, ensuring consistency with the original CTR information and avoiding contradictions.
----------
6->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.

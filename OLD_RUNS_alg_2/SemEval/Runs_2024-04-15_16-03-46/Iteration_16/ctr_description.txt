----------
10->

Extract essential information from the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections of Clinical Trial Reports. The Methods part covers research approach, interventions, and study subjects. The Results area presents statistical analyses and data displays. The Discussion section interprets findings, discusses implications, outlines study constraints, and relates results to related literature.
----------
11->

Retrieve the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections from both the clinical trial database and repository. Validate and confirm the essential information's accuracy, such as trial objectives, research approaches, interventions, subject demographics, statistical methods, outcomes, limitations, and related research. Assess each section: Methods (research design and interventions), Results (data outcomes and statistical tests), and Discussion (implications, limitations, and literature connections). Compile and compare the insights derived from each section to underscore their importance within the context of the clinical trial. Maintain uniformity between the data sources.
----------
12->

Obtain the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections from the clinical trial report database. Extract the trial objective, research goals, investigation methods and specifics, participant demographics and eligibility criteria, data analysis procedures and statistical tools used, visual representations of data, assessment of study weaknesses, and comparisons to related studies. Verify the extracted information aligns with the provided material descriptions concerning research strategies, intervention types, study demographics, data representation formats, statistical analysis methods, result interpretations, implications, and cited references. Maintain consistency and uniformity in data presentation across all sections and referenced materials.
----------
13->

Gather essential information from the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion segments of a Clinical Trial Report. The Methods segment details the research techniques, interventions, and study subjects. The Results section showcases statistical analyses and pertinent findings. The Discussion segment offers explanations of results, implications, limitations, and literature connections.
----------

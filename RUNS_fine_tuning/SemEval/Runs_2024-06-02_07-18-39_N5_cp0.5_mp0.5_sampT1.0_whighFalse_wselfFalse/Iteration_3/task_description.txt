0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Perform an in-depth examination of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to ascertain semantic alignment with expert clinical opinions on the efficacy and safety of innovative therapies. Break down the analysis into four principal components: (1) Eligibility Criteria, detailing patient inclusion parameters, (2) Intervention, describing treatment specifics including type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment length, (3) Results, encapsulating participant data, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and findings, and (4) Adverse Events, recording any noted signs and symptoms. Confirm that expert clinical assertions are corroborated by, and supported by, the data presented in these components for individual CTRs or across multiple CTRs.

2->

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by dissecting them into four principal sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, specifying patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION details, including treatment type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any observed signs and symptoms. Verify that clinical experts' statements are consistent with, supported by, and do not conflict with the data in these sections for a single CTR or across multiple CTRs.

0->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.
----------
1->Establish semantic entailment relations between specific provisions of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and relevant assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Focus on the key aspects of the NDA, including the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other critical terms. Determine whether each statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content, taking into account the nuances of the agreement's language and context.
----------
2->Develop a comprehensive analysis of the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to identify and establish semantic entailment relations between specific provisions and relevant assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Specifically, examine the key aspects of the NDA, including:

1. Definition of confidential information
2. Obligations of the parties
3. Duration of the agreement
4. Exclusions
5. Other critical terms

Evaluate each statement to determine whether it is supported or contradicted by the NDA content, taking into account the nuances of the agreement's language and context. This analysis will enable the identification of implicit and explicit relationships between the provisions and assertions, facilitating a deeper understanding of the NDA's confidentiality obligations.
----------
3->Assess support relationships between NDA sections and statements about confidentiality obligations, identifying claims that are either supported or contradicted by the agreement's framework.

0->Consider the problem of re-writing a textual instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the description while keeping the exact same meaning. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The re-written instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The re-written instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instruction.
----------
1->Think about the task of rephrasing a written instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the description while slightly changing the meaning. You should re-write the sentence with different words and feel free to add information that might give a better undestanding of the task.
----------
2->Examine the issue of modifying a written command. Rewrite it in a way that would improve the performance of an AI system like yourself when dealing with the given task. So, rewrite the textual instruction shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.
----------
3->

Refine the provided directive to enhance its execution by an Artificial Intelligence, maintaining clarity and fidelity to the original directive's intent and content.
----------
4->

Revise the provided textual directive to enhance an advanced AI's comprehension and execution capability for the task at hand. Ensure the rephrased directive remains true to the original intent.


RESULTING INSTRUCTION: 

Refine the given textual directive to optimize an AI's task performance, maintaining the directive's original purpose.
----------
5->

Rewrite a given textual directive to preserve its original meaning, targeting an expert audience. Opt for either a succinct version that encapsulates key elements in alignment with the initial purpose, or an extended rendition that incorporates definitions and additional elucidations for enhanced clarity. Erroneous details will result in penalties. Ensure the revised directive is clear, direct, and more instructive than its predecessor.

7->

Optimize the given directive for Artificial Intelligence execution, ensuring clarity and adherence to the original intent and content, tailored for a specialist audience. Condense or elaborate as necessary for enhanced clarity, avoiding inaccuracies to prevent penalties.
----------
8->

Revise the subsequent directive, maintaining its core intent, for a specialist audience. Produce a succinct version that reflects the principal concepts in line with the original directive's intent, or an expanded rendition that includes precise definitions and further elucidation to enhance comprehension. Note that any inaccuracies will incur penalties. Strive for clarity, brevity, and explicitness in detailing the task relative to the initial directive.

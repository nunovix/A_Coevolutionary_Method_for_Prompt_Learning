0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Trials involve patient groups, called cohorts or arms, which may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. A complete CTR contains 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.
----------
2->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical domain experts. CTRs provide detailed methodologies and outcomes of clinical trials, including ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Expert statements should align with CTR information, not contradicting any descriptions, to validate entailment. For a single CTR or comparative analysis of two CTRs, expert claims must be supported by corresponding CTR sections.
----------
3->Evaluate semantic entailment connections between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical domain experts. CTRs provide insights into the methodology and results of clinical trials assessing new treatments' efficacy and safety. They comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, describing treatment specifics, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcomes, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms. Expert statements claim information from these sections, either for a single CTR or when comparing two CTRs. Establish entailment by ensuring the statement is supported by, aligns with, and does not contradict the CTR data.
----------
4->Evaluate the semantic entailment relationships between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements within the clinical domain. Focus on the four key sections of CTRs: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Assess expert statements for entailment, ensuring alignment, support, and non-contradiction with the CTR data. This evaluation should encompass both single CTR references and comparative analyses of multiple CTRs.
----------
5->Determine the semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. CTRs provide methodology and findings for assessing new treatment effectiveness and safety, comprising four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA outlining patient participation conditions, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant count, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Establish entailment by ensuring statements are related to CTR sections, supported by the reports, and non-contradictory.
----------
6->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
7->Evaluate the semantic entailment relationships between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements within the clinical domain. CTRs provide detailed insights into clinical trials' methodologies and results across four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, defining patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, outlining treatments administered to different cohorts, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcomes, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Expert statements, whether referencing a single CTR or comparing multiple CTRs, should be assessed for entailment, ensuring alignment, support, and non-contradiction with the CTR data.

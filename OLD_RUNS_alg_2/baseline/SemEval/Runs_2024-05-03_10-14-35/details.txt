Total elapsed time: 1:25:13.106905
No. of iterations: 13
Average time per iteration: 0:06:33.315916

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 5
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 0
Max no. of iterations allowed: 200
Patience: 10
Decoder temperature in mutation and combiantions: 1.0
Top-p in sampling for mutation and combiantions: 0.8

Evaluation done on: dev set
With 200 examples

Name of the model used: mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
Mutation evaluation done with N=None, with probability=None

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Conduct a semantic entailment analysis between individual segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and claims made by clinical experts. Analyze the procedures and outcomes of clinical trials documented in CTRs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new medical treatments. Compare these analyses with expert assertions regarding data from specific CTR sections or between two CTRs for comparative evaluation. Confirm entailment by verifying that the expert claim is consistent with the clinical trial data, supported by the CTR, and does not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
2->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis linking expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), scrutinizing methodologies, results, treatment effectiveness, safety profiles, participant selection criteria, protocols, outcomes, and adverse reactions. Accurately depict expert evaluations on singular or comparative CTRs, grounded in CTR data, and congruent with the given descriptions. Rigorously assess the logical correlations between expert commentary and CTR extracts, verifying that claims are substantiated by evidence from the CTR, and in harmony with the provided descriptions.
----------
3->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis integrating expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), meticulously analyzing methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Represent expert analyses on individual or comparative CTRs accurately, ensuring these analyses are evidence-based, substantiated by the CTR data, and consistent with the provided descriptions. Critically evaluate the logical connections between expert statements and CTR excerpts, verifying that claims are evidence-based, supported by the CTR, and consistent with the provided descriptions.

Execute a detailed semantic entailment analysis correlating expert medical insights with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), scrutinizing methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Accurately reflect expert analyses on individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring claims are evidence-based, substantiated by the CTR data, and consistent with the provided descriptions. Critically evaluate the logical connections between expert statements and CTR excerpts, confirming that claims are substantiated by the CTR, align with the provided descriptions, and are free from contradictions.

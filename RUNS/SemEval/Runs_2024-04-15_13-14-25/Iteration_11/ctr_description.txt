1->

A Clinical Trial Report should consist of the following sections with detailed explanations:

1. Study Design: Description of the research design, including study category (interventional or observational), randomization process (participant allocation strategy), and masking approach (method to conceal information from study participants and researchers).
2. Methodology: Explanation of participant selection (criteria for choosing study subjects), sample size estimation (determination of the necessary number of participants), data acquisition techniques (procedures for obtaining data), statistical analysis approaches (methods for analyzing data), and implementation of standardized data collection procedures.
3. Results: Reporting of participant demographics (descriptive statistics about the study population), trial endpoints (primary objectives of the study), and statistical analysis outcomes (results of the data analysis).
4. Discussion: Interpretation of study findings (evaluation of the study's significance and implications),

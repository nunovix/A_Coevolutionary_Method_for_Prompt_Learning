0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Evaluate Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to determine the therapeutic interventions' efficacy and safety. Break down each CTR into four critical components:

1. Patient Inclusion Criteria: Identify the specific criteria for patient eligibility.

2. Treatment Specifications: Describe the treatment type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration.

3. Outcome Summary: Summarize the participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and key findings.

4. Adverse Effects Record: Document all observed adverse effects or symptoms.

Confirm clinical claims associated with individual CTRs or comparative analyses.

2->

Evaluate Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to determine the therapeutic interventions' efficacy and safety. Break down each CTR into four critical components:

1. Participant Selection Criteria: Detail the inclusion and exclusion criteria defining patient eligibility.

2. Treatment Protocol Specifications: Describe the type of intervention, exact dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration.

3. Outcome Metrics Analysis: Summarize participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and key findings.

4. Adverse Reactions Log: Document all adverse effects or symptoms encountered.

Cross-verify clinical claims within individual CTRs or across various reports.
----------
3->

Perform an in-depth examination of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to assess the therapeutic interventions' effectiveness and safety. Dissect each report into four principal sections:

1. Eligibility Criteria for Participants: Specify the inclusion criteria for patient selection.

2. Details of the Therapeutic Intervention: Describe the intervention type, dosage, frequency of administration, and duration of the treatment.

3. Summary of Results: Provide a concise overview of participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and principal findings.

4. Documentation of Adverse Events: Record all noted adverse reactions or symptoms. Validate clinical assertions related to specific CTRs or comparative analyses.
----------
4->

Conduct a comprehensive analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of therapeutic interventions. Break down each report into four critical components:

1. Participant Selection Criteria: Detail the inclusion criteria for patient selection.

2. Intervention Specifics: Outline the intervention type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration.

3. Outcome Summary: Summarize participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and key findings.

4. Adverse Event Logging: Document all observed adverse reactions or symptoms. Confirm clinical statements pertaining to individual CTRs or comparative analyses.

0->Assess the logical consistency between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. CTRs outline trial procedures and results, evaluating new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Expert statements should corroborate or refute claims about specific CTR sections or compare two CTRs. Validate entailment by ensuring statements are substantiated by CTR data and do not conflict with the report's content.

1->Evaluate the semantic entailment and logical consistency between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs document the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, assessing the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Expert statements should either corroborate or refute claims about specific CTR sections or make comparative analyses of two CTRs. For entailment and consistency validation, ensure that the statement's claim is substantiated by the CTR data and does not contradict any information provided in the report.
----------
2->Analyze the coherence and factual alignment between individual segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by specialists in the clinical field. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, which aim to determine the effectiveness and safety profiles of novel medical interventions. Specialists' assertions should either support or challenge specific segments of CTRs or offer comparative evaluations between two distinct CTRs. When verifying entailment and consistency, confirm that the specialist's assertion is backed by evidence within the CTR and does not conflict with the report's content.

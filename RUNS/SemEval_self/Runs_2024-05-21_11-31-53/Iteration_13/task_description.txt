0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Determine semantic entailment relationships between clinical trial report sections and domain expert statements. Analyze CTRs, summarizing eligibility criteria, intervention details, results, and adverse events. Examine expert claims about these sections or across different CTRs to validate or contradict them. Ensure claims are clinically relevant, supported by CTR data, and non-contradictory.
----------
2->Analyze semantic entailment relationships between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert claims, focusing on methodology, findings, eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Examine one or multiple CTRs for details on patient cohorts, treatment specifics, trial outcomes, and observed side effects. Ensure expert claims align with, and are supported by, the specific information in CTR sections, without any contradictions.
----------
3->Identify semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical experts. Recognize that CTRs document clinical trial methodologies and findings, evaluating treatment effectiveness and safety. Understand that trials comprise 1-2 patient groups with varying treatments or baseline characteristics. Analyze CTRs, consisting of four sections: (1) eligibility criteria for patient participation, (2) intervention details including treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) results summary, specifying participant count, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) adverse events listing signs and symptoms during trials. Assess statements regarding these sections, ensuring claims are supported by CTR data, relevant, and non-contradictory.
----------
4->Investigate the semantic entailment connections between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert conclusions regarding therapeutic results, emphasizing individual and comparative assessments across different groups. Confirm these associations by verifying that claims are consistent, evidence-based, and non-conflicting in relation to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, administered interventions, outcomes, and documented adverse events within CTRs.

0->Assess the semantic entailment between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements must be grounded in the CTR information and not contradict any provided descriptions. Evaluate CTRs across four key sections: Intervention, Eligibility Criteria, Results, and Adverse Events. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either within a single CTR or between two CTRs.

1->Analyze the logical connections between different parts of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements. To determine these connections, ensure that the statements align with the CTR data and do not conflict with the provided descriptions. Examine the CTRs across four main areas: Intervention, Eligibility Criteria, Results, and Adverse Events. Expert statements make assertions about the information within these sections, either within a single CTR or between multiple CTRs.
----------
2->To assess the semantic entailment between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), evaluate statements made by clinical domain experts against the corresponding information within four key sections: Intervention, Eligibility Criteria, Results, and Adverse Events. When assessing entailment, ensure that statements are grounded in the CTR information and do not contradict any provided descriptions. This involves examining statements that make claims about the information within these sections, either within a single CTR or between two CTRs.

0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

2->

Conduct a detailed semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-level clinical assertions, focusing on methodology, therapeutic efficacy, safety, inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention specifics, trial outcomes, and adverse event data. Decompose CTRs into four key sections: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Confirm that expert statements are evidence-based, clinically relevant, and narratively consistent with CTRs, avoiding contradictions with the provided descriptions.

3->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-level clinical assertions, with a focus on methodology, therapeutic efficacy, safety, inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention specifics, trial outcomes, and adverse event data. Break down CTRs into the following components: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Verify that expert statements are grounded in evidence, clinically pertinent, and maintain narrative consistency with CTRs, steering clear of any contradictions.

4->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and high-level clinical assertions, focusing on methodology, therapeutic outcomes, safety profiles, inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention details, trial results, and adverse event data. Decompose CTRs into key elements: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Ensure expert statements are evidence-based, clinically relevant, and narratively consistent with CTRs, avoiding contradictions.

5->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions, with a focus on methodology, therapeutic efficacy, safety, inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention specifics, trial outcomes, and adverse event data. Deconstruct CTRs into their fundamental components: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Verify that expert statements are grounded in evidence, clinically pertinent, and maintain narrative consistency with CTRs, steering clear of any contradictions.
----------
6->

Examine the semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. Focus on CTRs that document clinical trials assessing new treatments' efficacy and safety, involving one to two patient cohorts with varying treatments or baseline characteristics. Break down the analysis into four key CTR sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant count, outcome measures, units, and trial conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, noting observed patient signs and symptoms. Ensure expert statements related to CTR content are semantically entailed, supported by CTR data, and non-contradictory.
----------
7->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions, concentrating on methodology, therapeutic effectiveness, safety profiles, participant inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention particulars, trial results, and adverse event data. Decompose CTRs into the following components: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Ensure that expert statements are grounded in evidence, clinically pertinent, and maintain narrative consistency with CTRs, steering clear of contradictions. Confirm entailment by verifying that expert claims are congruent with clinical trial data, are backed by the CTR, and do not conflict with the given descriptions.

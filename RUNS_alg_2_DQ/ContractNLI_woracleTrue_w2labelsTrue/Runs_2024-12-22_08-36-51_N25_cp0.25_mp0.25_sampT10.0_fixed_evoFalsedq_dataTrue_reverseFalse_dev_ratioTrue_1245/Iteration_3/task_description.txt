0->Consider the challenge of assessing semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements. NDAs outline procedures and obligations for protecting confidential information, including its scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions. Evaluate whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions.

1->Assess the semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements to determine the extent to which the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions. Specifically, examine the scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions outlined in the NDA to evaluate the logical connections between the statements and the agreement's provisions.

2->You are tasked with identifying support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about these contents, and your task is to assess if these claims are supported or contradicted in the NDA.

0->To assess the semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements, evaluate whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's detailed descriptions, including:

1. Definition of confidential information
2. Obligations of the parties
3. Duration of protection
4. Exclusions
5. Other pertinent terms

Determine whether each statement aligns with the NDA content, considering the scope, usage obligations, and other relevant aspects of the agreement. The objective is to identify statements that are either supported or contradicted by the NDA, thereby assessing the semantic entailment between the statements and the agreement.
----------
1->Consider the task of assessing semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements. NDAs outline procedures and obligations for protecting confidential information, including its scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions. Evaluate whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions, which detail aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.
----------
2->To assess the semantic connection between specific clauses within Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements, scrutinize whether the statements' claims about the NDA are substantiated or refuted by the agreement's comprehensive details, encompassing:

1. The definition of sensitive information
2. The commitments of the parties involved
3. The timeframe for protection
4. Exemptions
5. Other key provisions

Evaluate each statement's alignment with the NDA's scope, usage requirements, and other pertinent elements of the agreement. Specifically, assess whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's detailed descriptions, including:

1. Definition of confidential information
2. Obligations of the parties
3. Duration of protection
4. Exclusions
5. Other pertinent terms

Determine the alignment of each statement with the NDA content, considering the scope, usage obligations, and other relevant aspects of the agreement. Identify statements that are either supported or contradicted by the NDA, thereby assessing the semantic entailment between the statements and the agreement.

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic evaluation to ascertain the linkage between segments within Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical assertions, verifying the therapeutic effectiveness and safety characteristics. Correlate expert declarations with CTRs' eligibility standards, intervention details, outcomes, and recorded adverse events, guaranteeing logical consistency and non-contradiction across singular or multiple CTRs.
----------
2->

Perform a detailed semantic analysis to correlate segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with authoritative clinical claims, verifying the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Ensure alignment with expert testimonies regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse events across individual or multiple CTRs, confirming consistency and the absence of contradictions with expert clinical assertions.
----------
3->

Identify and elucidate the supportive associations between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical assertions. Analyze CTRs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Break down CTRs into four primary components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, cataloging observed signs and symptoms. Examine statements that substantiate information from these components, either referencing a single CTR or contrasting two.

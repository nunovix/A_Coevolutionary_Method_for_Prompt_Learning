0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical specialists. CTRs detail the procedures and results of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Conversely, specialists' assertions focus on specific sections of CTRs, either for a single report or for a comparative examination of two. To validate entailment, ensure that the specialist's claim is consistent with the clinical trial data, is substantiated by the CTR, and does not contradict the given descriptions.
----------
2->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment and comparative evaluation of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical perspectives, scrutinizing their methodologies, outcomes, therapeutic effectiveness, and safety evaluations. Strictly follow clinical protocols, utilize exact medical jargon, and ensure semantic congruence with expert assertions. Confirm this congruence by cross-verifying CTR data, aligning with pertinent CTRs, and upholding consistency with expert-provided specifics.
----------
3->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment and comparative analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical testimonials. Thoroughly examine the data, methodologies, outcomes, therapeutic efficacy, and safety evaluations. Maintain strict adherence to clinical protocols throughout the process. Confirm semantic consistency, ensure alignment of findings with pertinent CTRs, and corroborate specific sections or comparative analyses with expert testimonies. Utilize precise medical terminology and rigorously follow clinical guidelines.

4->Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment and comparative evaluation between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical expert statements, focusing on methodologies, results, therapeutic efficacy, and safety assessments. Rigorously follow clinical guidelines, employ precise medical terminology, and ensure semantic congruence with expert assertions. Confirm this congruence by cross-referencing CTR data, corroborating with pertinent CTRs, and preserving consistency with expert-provided details.

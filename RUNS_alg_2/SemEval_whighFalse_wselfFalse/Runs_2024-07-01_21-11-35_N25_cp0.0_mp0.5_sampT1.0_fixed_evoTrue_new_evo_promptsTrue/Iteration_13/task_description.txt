0->Analyze the semantic entailment between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical domain specialists. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and results of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapies. Statements, conversely, posit assertions regarding particular sections of CTRs pertaining to a singular CTR or contrasting two CTRs. Validate entailment by ensuring the statement's claim is corroborated by the CTR data and does not conflict with any given descriptions.
----------
1->Analyze the semantic entailment relationships between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical domain expert assertions. Verify that these assertions are supported by CTR data and do not contradict the provided descriptions. Evaluate statements related to individual and comparative CTRs. Decompose CTRs into four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient inclusion conditions; (2) INTERVENTION, describing administered treatments to different patient groups; (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics and trial outcomes; and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed adverse signs and symptoms.

2->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
3->Evaluate the semantic entailment between different segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and claims made by clinical domain experts. CTRs document the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, determining the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Verify entailment by confirming that the expert's claim is supported by the CTR data and does not contradict any provided descriptions.

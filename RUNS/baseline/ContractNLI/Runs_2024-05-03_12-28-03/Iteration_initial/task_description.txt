0->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether statements regarding the NDA content are supported by the text or contradict it.
----------
1->Your task involves identifying support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about this content, and your role is to assess if these claims are supported or contradicted in the NDA.
----------
2->Evaluate the semantic entailment between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements related to the confidentiality obligations they impose. NDAs govern the sharing and protection of sensitive data, outlining the scope of confidential information, obligations, agreement lifespan, and exclusions. Assess whether statements' claims about the NDA content align with or contradict information covered in the agreement.
----------
3->The objective is to scrutinize semantic entailment relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and expressed statements regarding confidentiality obligations. NDAs specify conditions for handling sensitive information, including its definition, parties' obligations, agreement term, and exclusions. Examine statements to determine if their claims about the NDA are substantiated by the agreement's text or contradict it.
----------
4->Consider the challenge of assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements. NDAs outline procedures and obligations for protecting confidential information, including its scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions. Your task is to evaluate whether statements' assertions about the NDA content are supported by the agreement or contradict it.

0->Evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety data presented in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), which detail trial protocols and outcomes for new therapies' effectiveness and safety. CTRs are structured into four critical sections: (1) Participant Eligibility Criteria, (2) Treatment Protocol, specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Participant Characteristics and Outcome Measures, including units and interpretations, and (4) Recorded Adverse Events. Conduct individual or comparative analyses of the data across various CTRs.

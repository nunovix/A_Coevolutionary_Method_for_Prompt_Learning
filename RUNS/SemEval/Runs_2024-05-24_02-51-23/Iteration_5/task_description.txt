0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

2->Evaluate semantic correspondence between expert assertions and the criteria for participant qualification, prescribed clinical actions, evaluated outcomes, and reported side effects within Clinical Trial Documents, guaranteeing congruence, justification-based coherence, consistency, and absence of contradiction in both singular and comparative examinations.
----------
3->Assess the semantic entailment between discrete segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. This entails:

1. Verifying that the expert claims correspond precisely with the content of specified CTR segments.

2. Ensuring that the claims have supporting evidence within the relevant CTRs, corroborating their legitimacy.

3. Guaranteeing coherence and avoidance of contradictions with the content of the CTR segments.

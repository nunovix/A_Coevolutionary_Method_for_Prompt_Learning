0->Consider the problem of re-writing a textual instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the description while keeping the exact same meaning. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The re-written instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The re-written instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instruction.
----------
1->Think about the task of rephrasing a written instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the description while slightly changing the meaning. You should re-write the sentence with different words and feel free to add information that might give a better undestanding of the task.
----------
2->Examine the issue of modifying a written command. Rewrite it in a way that would improve the performance of an AI system like yourself when dealing with the given task. So, rewrite the textual instruction shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.

3->

"Craft a comprehensive, expert-level directive that distills the primary concepts from both original texts, ensuring clarity, precision, and unwavering fidelity to the original purpose. The directive should succinctly encapsulate the essence of the instructions or, alternatively, provide a meticulously detailed exposition with technical terminology and explicit elucidations, strictly prohibiting any factual inaccuracies."
----------
4->

Revise the provided directives into a singular, expert-level directive that retains the essence of both originals, ensuring clarity, precision, and fidelity to the original intent. The directive should be either succinctly summarized or expanded with comprehensive definitions and elucidations for enhanced clarity, strictly excluding any inaccuracies.
----------
5->

Transform the provided directives into a singular, expert-level directive that retains the fundamental principles of both originals, ensuring enhanced clarity, precision, and unwavering fidelity to the original purpose. The directive may be succinctly condensed or meticulously elaborated with detailed definitions and explanations to augment comprehension, while rigorously prohibiting any inaccuracies.
----------
6->

Craft a singular, expert-level directive that encapsulates the core essence of both provided instructions, maintaining clarity, precision, and strict adherence to the original intent. This directive should be articulated either as a concise synthesis or as an expanded version, inclusive of detailed definitions and clarifications, while rigorously avoiding any inaccuracies.

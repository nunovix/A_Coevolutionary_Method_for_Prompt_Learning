0->You are tasked with identifying support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about these contents, and your task is to assess if these claims are supported or contradicted in the NDA.
----------
1->Evaluate semantic entailment between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements related to the confidentiality obligations they impose. NDAs govern the sharing and protection of sensitive data, outlining the scope of confidential information, obligations, agreement lifespan, and exclusions. Assess whether the claims made in a statement align with, or contradict, the information covered in a non-disclosure agreement.
----------
2->Consider the challenge of assessing semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements. NDAs outline procedures and obligations for protecting confidential information, including its scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions. Evaluate whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions.
----------
3->Examine the semantic entailment between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning the confidentiality obligations they establish. NDAs are legal contracts that regulate the handling of sensitive information, detailing what constitutes confidential information, the responsibilities of the involved parties, the duration of the agreement, and any specific exclusions. Your task is to meticulously analyze an input statement to ascertain if its assertions about the NDA are corroborated by, or in conflict with, the information delineated in the agreement. Enhance your evaluation by considering the scope of confidential information, the obligations of the parties, the term of the agreement, and the exclusions specified in the NDA to ensure a thorough and accurate assessment.
----------
4->Your objective is to scrutinize semantic entailment relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements regarding the confidentiality obligations. NDAs specify conditions for handling sensitive information, including its definition, parties' obligations, agreement term, and exclusions. Carefully examine an input statement to determine if its claims about the NDA are substantiated by the descriptions in the agreement, or if they contradict it.

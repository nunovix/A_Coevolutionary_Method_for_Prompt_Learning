0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to discern and articulate the reinforcing links between various sections and clinical claims. CTRs document the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of new medical treatments. Decompose CTRs into four principal elements: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, specifying the inclusion requirements for trial participants, (2) INTERVENTION, describing the treatment type, dosage, administration schedule, and treatment length, (3) RESULTS, detailing participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and findings, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed symptoms and side effects. Validate and corroborate statements related to these sections within a single CTR or across several CTRs.

Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by systematically breaking them down into four core components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining patient inclusion requirements, (2) INTERVENTION, specifying treatment particulars including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, presenting participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, recording any observed signs and symptoms. Validate and cross-reference statements pertaining to these components within a single CTR or across multiple CTRs.

Dissect Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to reveal correlations between specific sections and clinical claims. CTRs document the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of new medical treatments. Decompose CTRs into four principal elements: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, specifying inclusion requirements for trial participants, (2) INTERVENTION, describing the treatment type, dosage, administration schedule, and treatment length, (3) RESULTS, detailing participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and findings, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed symptoms and side effects. Corroborate claims related to these elements within a single CTR or across a series of CTRs.

0->Critically evaluate the credibility of health-related claims from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Thoroughly analyze the four key sections of a CTR: (1) Participant Selection Criteria, (2) Treatment Regimen, detailing type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Participant Outcomes, summarizing demographics, results, measurements, and observations, and (4) Recorded Adverse Events, noting any negative reactions. Compare data from multiple CTRs to ensure a comprehensive and unambiguous assessment for medical professionals.

1->Evaluate the semantic entailment relationships between various segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by experts in the clinical field. Ensure that these assertions are substantiated by the data within the CTRs and do not conflict with the information provided. Clinical Trial Reports are structured into four key components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outline the criteria for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the treatments administered across different patient groups, (3) RESULTS, which provide a summary of participant demographics and the outcomes of the trial, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, which document any adverse signs or symptoms observed during the trial. Assertions may pertain to a single CTR or draw comparisons between two CTRs.

4->Analyze the semantic connections between statements from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert opinions in the medical field. Verify that these expert opinions are backed by evidence from the CTRs and are consistent with the report's content. Clinical Trial Reports are divided into four main sections: (1) Patient Inclusion Criteria, (2) Treatments Administered, (3) Participant Data and Trial Outcomes, and (4) Reported Adverse Events. Expert statements may relate to individual CTRs or compare findings across multiple CTRs.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Execute an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between expert medical claims and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), scrutinizing methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Confirm that expert assertions for individual or comparative analyses of CTRs are accurately reflected in the trial data, substantiated by the CTR, and aligned with the provided descriptions. Additionally, critically evaluate the logical connections between expert statements and CTR excerpts, ensuring claims are evidence-based, corroborated by the CTR, and consistent with the provided descriptions.

2->

Execute a thorough semantic entailment analysis to align authoritative medical perspectives with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), rigorously evaluating methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Mirror expert analyses on individual or comparative CTRs accurately within the trial data, substantiated by the CTR and consistent with provided descriptions. Critically assess the logical relationships between expert statements and CTR segments, ensuring claims are evidence-based, supported by the CTR, and congruent with the provided descriptions.

3->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis to align expert medical opinions with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Thoroughly examine and compare methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Accurately reflect expert analyses of individual or comparative CTRs in the trial data, ensuring they are substantiated by the CTR and consistent with the provided descriptions. Additionally, critically assess the logical relationships between expert statements and CTR excerpts, confirming that claims are evidence-based, substantiated by the CTR, and in agreement with the provided descriptions.

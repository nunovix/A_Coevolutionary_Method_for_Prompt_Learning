0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between authoritative clinical statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Specifically, scrutinize Eligibility Criteria, Interventions, Outcomes, and Adverse Reactions. Cross-verify expert assertions by examining CTRs, reconciling inconsistencies, and maintaining uniformity in singular and comparative analyses across diverse CTRs.
----------
2->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between expert clinical statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), verifying that expert claims are substantiated by CTRs without contradictions. Correlate expert assertions with corresponding CTR sections on Eligibility Criteria, Intervention specifics, Outcomes, and Adverse Reactions, for both individual and comparative assessments across a range of CTRs.
----------
3->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between authoritative clinical assertions and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Confirm that these expert statements are both supported and non-contradictory to the information presented in CTRs. Align these statements with the respective CTRs' Eligibility Criteria, Interventions, Results, and Adverse Events sections. Maintain consistency in individual and comparative analyses across a variety of CTRs.
----------
4->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between authoritative clinical statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Validate expert claims by referencing CTRs, resolving any inconsistencies. Link expert assertions with corresponding sections in CTRs related to Eligibility Criteria, Intervention specifics, Outcomes, and Adverse Reactions. Ensure consistency in singular and comparative analyses across multiple CTRs.

0->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the validity of clinical statements. CTRs contain four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Determine if statements accurately reflect the content of these sections or compare findings between two CTRs.
----------
1->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify the accuracy of clinical statements. CTRs are structured into four main sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Treatment Protocol, (3) Outcomes, and (4) Adverse Events. Assess the truthfulness of clinical claims by carefully comparing them with the relevant parts of the CTRs, ensuring a thorough and scientifically rigorous evaluation.
----------
2->Review Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to assess the accuracy of clinical statements. CTRs are structured into four main parts: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Verify that statements are consistent with the information presented in these sections or contrast findings from different CTRs.
----------
3->Analyze Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the validity of medical assertions. These documents are divided into four main sections: (1) Participant Eligibility or ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) Treatment Administered or INTERVENTION, (3) Observed Outcomes or RESULTS, and (4) Reported Side Effects or ADVERSE EVENTS. Verify if the claims are consistent with the information provided in these sections or contrast data from different CTDs/CTRs. Ensure that your analysis is comprehensive, accurate, and reflects a thorough understanding of the clinical trial process.
----------
4->Carefully review Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs), focusing on four key sections: (1) Participant Eligibility, (2) Treatment Administered, (3) Observed Outcomes, and (4) Reported Side Effects. Ensure the medical claims align with the data in these sections or compare findings across various CTDs for consistency.

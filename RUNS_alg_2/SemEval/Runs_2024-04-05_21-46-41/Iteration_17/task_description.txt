Determine if statements made by clinical experts logically align with the content of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). The entailment exists when the statement's implications are contained within the CTR sections without contradiction. CTRs consist of four main parts: (1) Eligibility Criteria outlining patient conditions, (2) Intervention detailing treatment information, (3) Results presenting trial data, and (4) Adverse Events documenting observed symptoms. Statements are sentences that derive conclusions from these CTR components, focusing on a single report or comparative analysis. Ensure that the statement's claim directly relates to the clinical trial information for entailment to be established. Each trial encompasses one or two patient groups, referred to as cohorts or arms, which may receive varying treatments or possess distinct baseline characteristics.

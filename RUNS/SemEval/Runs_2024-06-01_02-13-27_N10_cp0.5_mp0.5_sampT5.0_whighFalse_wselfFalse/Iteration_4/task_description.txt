0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical experts, specifically assessing the effectiveness and safety profiles of novel therapeutics. Analyze CTRs segmented into four primary components: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Confirm that expert assertions align with CTR details, are supported by the reports, and are in agreement with the given descriptions. Focus on the intricacies of each CTR section when evaluating entailment.

2->"

Conduct a semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical expert assertions, with a focus on assessing the efficacy and safety of innovative treatments. Examine structured CTRs divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, outlining treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and trial length, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant numbers, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any patient symptoms observed during the trial. Ensure expert statements are congruent with CTR data, substantiated by the reports, and consistent with given descriptions. Pay particular attention to the details within each section of the CTR when confirming entailment.

3->

Conduct a semantic entailment analysis between separate parts of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and claims made by clinical experts. Analyze the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new medical treatments. Compare expert claims regarding information within a single CTR or across multiple CTRs for comparative purposes. Verify entailment by confirming that the expert claim aligns with the clinical trial data, is supported by the CTR, and does not contradict the provided descriptions.

4->Conduct a semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical specialists' assertions, with a focus on assessing the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Examine CTRs divided into four key sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Verify that expert claims are in line with CTR content, substantiated by the reports, and consistent with provided descriptions. Pay particular attention to the details within each section of the CTRs when confirming entailment, ensuring that comparative analyses between claims and CTRs are accurate and conflict-free.

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Execute a comprehensive semantic evaluation to align data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines, verifying the efficacy and safety of medical interventions. Authenticate and harmonize expert consensus on eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, expected results, and adverse event documentation through singular and comparative analyses of CTRs. Uphold logical coherence, prevent contradictions, and ensure strict compliance with established clinical expertise regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, anticipated outcomes, and adverse event reporting.

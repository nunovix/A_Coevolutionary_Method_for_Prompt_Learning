0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the validity of clinical statements regarding patient eligibility, intervention specifics, results, and adverse events. Each CTR is divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the treatment's type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and final conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any unexpected signs or symptoms observed during the trial. Assess the accuracy and relevance of claims made about these sections, whether they pertain to a single CTR or involve a comparative analysis between two.

2->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to meticulously evaluate the veracity and pertinence of information pertaining to patient eligibility, treatment specifics, trial outcomes, and reported adverse events. Dissect each CTR into four separate sections: (1) Patient Eligibility, outlining inclusion and exclusion criteria, (2) Treatment Protocol, describing the treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Trial Findings, condensing participant demographics, outcome metrics, measurement units, and conclusions, and (4) Safety Observations, documenting any unanticipated signs or symptoms observed during the trial. Scrutinize the accuracy and relevance of statements within these segments, either individually for each CTR or collectively when comparing multiple reports.
----------
3->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify the accuracy and pertinence of participant eligibility criteria, treatment protocols, study findings, and safety observations. Break down each report into four distinct sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Treatment Details, (3) Results, and (4) Safety Data. Assess the correctness and relevance of the information presented in these sections, individually or when comparing two reports.
----------
4->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to critically assess the accuracy and relevance of patient eligibility criteria, treatment protocols, trial findings, and safety observations. Break down each CTR into four distinct sections: (1) Patient Eligibility, detailing inclusion and exclusion criteria, (2) Treatment Protocol, specifying the treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Trial Findings, summarizing participant demographics, outcome metrics, measurement units, and conclusions, and (4) Safety Observations, recording any unanticipated signs or symptoms. Evaluate the veracity and pertinence of statements within these segments, individually for each CTR or collectively when comparing multiple reports.

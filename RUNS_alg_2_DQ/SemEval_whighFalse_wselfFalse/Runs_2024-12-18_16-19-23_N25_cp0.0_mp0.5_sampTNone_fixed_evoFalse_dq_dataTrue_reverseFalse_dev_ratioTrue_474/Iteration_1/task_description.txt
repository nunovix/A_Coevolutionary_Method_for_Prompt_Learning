0->The objective is to examine semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements articulated by clinical domain experts. CTRs elaborate on the procedures and findings of clinical trials, which aim at assessing treatment effectiveness and safety. Each trial involves cohorts of patients exposed to distinct treatments or exhibiting diverse baseline characteristics. Comprehensive CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, delineating conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detaining the treatments, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, cataloging relevant observations. Statements posit claims regarding the clinical information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. Establishing entailment requires assessing if the statements are compatible with the clinical trial data, avoiding any contradictions with the CTRs.
----------
1->Your task is to evaluate the validity of clinical statements by examining specific parts of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs provide detailed information about clinical trials, including the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. These reports are divided into four main components: (1) eligibility criteria, (2) intervention details, (3) results summaries, and (4) adverse event listings. Statements in CTRs make assertions about the information in these sections, either for a single report or for comparisons between multiple reports.
----------
2->To establish semantic entailment relations between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, analyze the relationships between four key sections of a CTR: eligibility criteria, intervention descriptions, results summaries, and adverse event listings. Expert statements, typically in the form of sentences, make claims about specific CTR sections, either individually or in comparison. For entailment to be established, these claims must be grounded in the CTR data, align with the provided descriptions, and avoid contradictions.
----------
3->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Trials involve patient groups, called cohorts or arms, which may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. A complete CTR contains 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
4->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.

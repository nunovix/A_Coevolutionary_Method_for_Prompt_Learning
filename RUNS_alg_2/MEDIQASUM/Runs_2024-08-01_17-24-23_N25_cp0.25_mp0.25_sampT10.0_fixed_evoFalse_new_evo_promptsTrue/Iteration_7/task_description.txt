0->Draft a medical note for an encounter between a healthcare provider and a patient. Attend to the most relevant information from a transcript of the conversation, identifying key clinical concepts such as medications, diseases, conditions, injuries, signs and symptoms. Structure the note according to standard formats, such as SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) or APSO (assessment, plan, subjective, objective). Be thorough, clear, and brief. You'll also be provided with an example note so you can know the structure we are looking for in the note.
----------
1->Summarize the physician-patient dialogue into a structured clinical note. Start with the patient's chief complaint and pertinent medical history. Then, detail objective findings and measurements. Follow with the physician's evaluation and diagnosis. Conclude with the prescribed medication regimen and the schedule for patient follow-up.
----------
2->Compose a healthcare note that encapsulates all the relevant information in a verbal exchange between a doctor and a patient. Adhere to standard recommendations for structuring clinical notes, considering parts such as the History of the Present Illness (HPI), a Review of Systems (ROS), conclusions from a Physical Examination (PE), lab and imaging results, and other relevant tests, and finally the doctor's Assessment and treatment Plan (A/P). As a way to aid you in the wrtiting of the note, you'll also be provided with an example note. Use it as a way to know the proper structure you should use.
----------
3->"Craft a comprehensive clinical note that accurately reflects the dialogue between a healthcare provider and a patient. Ensure the note follows the conventional format for medical documentation, which includes sections such as the History of Present Illness (HPI), Review of Systems (ROS), findings from the Physical Examination (PE), laboratory and imaging test outcomes, and additional pertinent assessments. Utilize the provided example note as a guide to maintain the correct organizational structure."

RESULT:

The rephrased instruction now clearly outlines the task of creating a detailed clinical note that mirrors the conversation between a doctor and a patient. It specifies the necessary components of the note, such as HPI, ROS, PE findings, lab/imaging results, and additional assessments, and instructs the use of an example note for structural guidance.
----------
4->Begin by capturing the patient's main health issue and pertinent medical history. Record all observable symptoms and vital signs as part of the objective findings. Continue with the healthcare provider's assessment, leading to a definitive diagnosis. Conclude by detailing the treatment plan, specifying medications, dosages, and administration frequency, along with scheduling the subsequent appointment for the patient.
----------
5->Compose a detailed clinical note that encapsulates the critical points from a healthcare provider's interaction with a patient. The note should be structured to include the patient's History of Present Illness (HPI), a comprehensive Review of Systems (ROS), findings from the Physical Examination (PE), and the healthcare provider's Assessment and Treatment Plan (A/P). Use the exemplar note as a reference for the format. Additionally, create a concise medical note based on a conversation transcript, focusing on pertinent clinical details such as medications, diseases, conditions, injuries, signs, and symptoms. Organize the note using a recognized format like SOAP or APSO, ensuring it is succinct and comprehensible.
----------
6->Create a concise clinical note from the physician-patient conversation. Begin with the patient's primary reason for the visit and relevant health background. Next, record vital signs and physical examination results. Proceed with the doctor's assessment and final diagnosis. End with the treatment plan, including medication names, dosages, and follow-up appointments.

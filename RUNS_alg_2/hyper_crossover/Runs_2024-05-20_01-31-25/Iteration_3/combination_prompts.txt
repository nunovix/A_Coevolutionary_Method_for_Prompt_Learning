0->Consider the problem of combining two different textual instructions, pertaining to the same task. The objective is to rephrase the main information common to the two descriptions, while keeping their meaning and intent. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The combined instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The combined instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instructions. Considering the aforementioned task description, combine the two textual instructions shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.
----------
1->"Devise two advanced written guidelines on identical tasks by rephrasing their central shared concepts, maintaining their initial purposes and meanings. Produce either a condensed version that distills essential information aligned with the original guidelines, or an enriched manual including more nuanced explanations and expansions. Exclude punishment for slight deviations and confirm the guidance is straightforward, unequivocal, and further clarifies the task compared to the original guidelines."
----------
2->Develop two advanced-level guides on the same subject, tailored for field specialists. Redefine the common knowledge within, maintaining their original intent and functions. Construct an expert-level, clear-cut directive that either condenses the vital information for the initial goals, or expands with definitions and in-depth clarifications. Prioritize accuracy to avoid mistakes, and aim for a directive that is more understandable than the original.
----------
3->Re-craft two specialized instructions related to the same task, ensuring that the amalgamated instruction maintains the core intent and meaning. Target the expert audience, and strive for brevity and clarity, either condensing the original instructions or enhancing them with expert-level terminology and additional explanations. Penalties apply for inaccuracies. Produce a succinct yet comprehensive directive for executing the task with improved clarity over the original instructions.

"Merge the next two technical instructions on a similar subject, preserving their central purpose and significance. The audience should be industry experts, and the result should be either a more concise version or a detailed, enriched one, avoiding any misinformation. Aim for a clear and efficient instruction for task execution, outperforming the original instructions in clarity."
----------
4->Create a detailed and enhanced guide that merges two expert-level instructions related to the same topic. The guide should maintain the original intent and information but present it with greater clarity and precision, potentially in a more concise format.

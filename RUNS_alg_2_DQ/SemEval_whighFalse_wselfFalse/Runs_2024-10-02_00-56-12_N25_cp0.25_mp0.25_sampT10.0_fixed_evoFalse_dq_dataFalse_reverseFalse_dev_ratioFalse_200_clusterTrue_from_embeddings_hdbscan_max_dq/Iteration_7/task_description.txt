0->Assess the logical consistency between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. CTRs outline trial procedures and results, evaluating new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Expert statements should corroborate or refute claims about specific CTR sections or compare two CTRs. Validate entailment by ensuring statements are substantiated by CTR data and do not conflict with the report's content.

1->Evaluate the logical consistency or semantic entailment between specific sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements in the medical field. CTRs record the methods and outcomes of clinical trials, assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Expert statements may either support or dispute assertions about certain parts of a CTR or compare findings from different CTRs. To verify consistency or entailment, the expert statement's claim must be substantiated by the CTR data and not conflict with any of the reported details.
----------
2->Evaluate the semantic entailment and logical consistency between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs document the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, assessing the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Expert statements should either corroborate or refute claims about specific CTR sections or make comparative analyses of two CTRs. For entailment and consistency validation, ensure that the statement's claim is substantiated by the CTR data and does not contradict any information provided in the report.

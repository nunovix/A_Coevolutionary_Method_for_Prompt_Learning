0->Draft a medical note for an encounter between a healthcare provider and a patient. Attend to the most relevant information from a transcript of the conversation, identifying key clinical concepts such as medications, diseases, conditions, injuries, signs and symptoms. Structure the note according to standard formats, such as SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) or APSO (assessment, plan, subjective, objective). Be thorough, clear, and brief. You'll also be provided with an example note so you can know the structure we are looking for in the note.
----------
1->Summarize the physician-patient dialogue into a structured clinical note. Start with the patient's chief complaint and pertinent medical history. Then, detail objective findings and measurements. Follow with the physician's evaluation and diagnosis. Conclude with the prescribed medication regimen and the schedule for patient follow-up.
----------
2->Compose a healthcare note that encapsulates all the relevant information in a verbal exchange between a doctor and a patient. Adhere to standard recommendations for structuring clinical notes, considering parts such as the History of the Present Illness (HPI), a Review of Systems (ROS), conclusions from a Physical Examination (PE), lab and imaging results, and other relevant tests, and finally the doctor's Assessment and treatment Plan (A/P). As a way to aid you in the wrtiting of the note, you'll also be provided with an example note. Use it as a way to know the proper structure you should use.
----------
3->Begin by documenting the patient's primary health concern and relevant medical background. Proceed to record all observable symptoms and vital signs. Next, articulate the healthcare provider's assessment and conclusive diagnosis. Finally, outline the prescribed treatment plan, including medication names, dosages, and frequency, as well as scheduling the next appointment for the patient.

RESULT:

The rephrased instruction now clearly delineates the steps for creating a clinical note, starting with the patient's chief complaint and medical history, followed by objective findings, the healthcare provider's evaluation and diagnosis, and concluding with the treatment plan and follow-up schedule.
----------
4->Craft a comprehensive clinical note that captures the essence of a dialogue between a healthcare provider and a patient. Ensure the note adheres to the conventional format of clinical documentation, which includes the patient's History of Present Illness (HPI), a thorough Review of Systems (ROS), findings from the Physical Examination (PE), and interpretations of laboratory and imaging studies. Conclude with the healthcare provider's Assessment and proposed Treatment Plan (A/P). Utilize the provided exemplar note to guide the structure of your documentation.

5->"Craft a comprehensive clinical note that accurately reflects the dialogue between a healthcare provider and a patient. Ensure the note follows the conventional format for medical documentation, which includes sections such as the History of Present Illness (HPI), Review of Systems (ROS), findings from the Physical Examination (PE), laboratory and imaging test outcomes, and additional pertinent assessments. Utilize the provided example note as a guide to maintain the correct organizational structure."

RESULT:

The rephrased instruction now clearly outlines the task of creating a detailed clinical note that mirrors the conversation between a doctor and a patient. It specifies the necessary components of the note, such as HPI, ROS, PE findings, lab/imaging results, and additional assessments, and instructs the use of an example note for structural guidance.

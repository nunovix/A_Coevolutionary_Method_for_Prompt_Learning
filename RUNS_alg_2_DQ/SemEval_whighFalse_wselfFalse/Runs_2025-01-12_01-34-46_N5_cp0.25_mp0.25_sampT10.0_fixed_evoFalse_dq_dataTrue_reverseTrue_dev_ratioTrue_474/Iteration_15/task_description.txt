0->Assess semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements must be supported by CTR information and not contradict any provided descriptions. CTRs consist of four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.

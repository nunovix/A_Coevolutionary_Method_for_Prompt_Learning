0->Evaluate the semantic entailment and logical consistency between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs document the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, assessing the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Expert statements should either corroborate or refute claims about specific CTR sections or make comparative analyses of two CTRs. For entailment and consistency validation, ensure that the statement's claim is substantiated by the CTR data and does not contradict any information provided in the report.

1->Assess the coherence and factual alignment between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and pronouncements made by specialists in the medical field. Clinical Trial Reports record the procedures and findings of clinical studies, determining the effectiveness and risk profile of novel therapies. Specialists' pronouncements should either support or challenge assertions about particular segments of CTRs or offer comparisons between two CTRs. To verify coherence and factual alignment, confirm that the specialist's pronouncement is backed by the data in the CTR and does not conflict with the report's content.
----------
2->Assess the congruence between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert analyses, verifying that expert perspectives are corroborated by CTR data and are consistent with the report's content.

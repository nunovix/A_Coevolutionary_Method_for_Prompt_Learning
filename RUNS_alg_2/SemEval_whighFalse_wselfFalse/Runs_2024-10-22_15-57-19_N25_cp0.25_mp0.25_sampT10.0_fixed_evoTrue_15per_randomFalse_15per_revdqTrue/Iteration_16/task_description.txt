2->Evaluate the consistency of professional claims with corresponding Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), confirming that expert statements are substantiated by the CTRs and are congruent with the reported content. CTRs are categorized into four main sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Verify the consistency for individual CTRs or contrast two CTRs.
----------
3->Assess the congruence of clinical experts' opinions with the evidence provided in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Verify that the experts' insights are substantiated by the CTR data and do not conflict with the specified sections: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events.

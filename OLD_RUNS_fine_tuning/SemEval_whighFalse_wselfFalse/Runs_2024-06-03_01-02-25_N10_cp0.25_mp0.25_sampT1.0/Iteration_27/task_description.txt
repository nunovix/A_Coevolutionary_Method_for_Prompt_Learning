Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis correlating Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with expert clinical narratives to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness and safety profiles of new medical treatments. This necessitates a thorough examination of clinical trial protocols and results, verifying that expert assertions are definitively supported by data from CTRs, congruent with established descriptions, and free from inconsistencies. Systematically deconstruct each component of the CTRs to facilitate interstudy comparisons for an all-encompassing assessment.

Evaluate statements for compliance with NDA terms concerning confidential materials, obligations, duration, exclusions, and related conditions. Identify discrepancies or conflicting statements with the defined confidential data, permitted uses, durations, exclusions, and protective measures in the NDAs. Guarantee that statements correspond with NDA provisions relating to data usage, sharing, and safeguarding responsibilities.
----------
11->

Evaluate the conformity of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with the confidentiality clauses in the respective agreements. Analyze the statements in the NDAs for uniformity in terms of scope, usage restrictions, duration, and exceptions. Determine any inconsistencies or discrepancies that might arise between the NDA language and the agreement's confidentiality terms.
----------
12->

Assess statements for compatibility with key elements in given Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). Examine NDA definitions of confidential materials, obligations, agreement durations, exclusions, and other significant terms. Compare each statement to ensure consistency or identify potential contradictions with these NDA components.
----------
13->

1. Examine the definitions of confidential information in both the NDA text and confidentiality declarations for consistency.
2. Ensure that parties' obligations under the NDA and confidentiality agreements align.
3. Match the durations of the NDA and confidentiality agreements.
4. Identify and resolve any discrepancies in permitted uses, durations, and exclusions between the NDA text and confidentiality declarations.
----------
14->

Assess the conformity of statements with the confidentiality provisions and terminology in Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs):

1. Confirm that the statement definitions for confidential information align with the NDA definitions.
2. Examine the confidentiality duties of all parties in both the NDA and the statements for consistency.
3. Guarantee that the confidentiality agreement durations in the statements correspond to the NDA term lengths.
4. Judge whether any confidentiality exceptions in the statements align with those outlined in the NDA.
----------
15->

1. Identify semantic relationships between NDA statements and NDA text concerning confidentiality obligations.
2. Extract NDA definitions of confidential information, party obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, and key terms.
3. Evaluate given statements against NDA provisions for conformity or contradiction.
----------
16->

Assess the conformity of confidentiality declarations in Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with the NDA's overall text. The evaluation process involves:

1. Verifying that the definitions of confidential materials match in both the declarations and the NDA.
2. Comparing the obligations of confidentiality for all involved parties in the declarations and the NDA.
3. Confirming that the agreement durations correspond in both the declarations and the NDA.
4. Examining consistent confidentiality exclusions across the declarations and the NDA.
5. Ensuring each declaration adheres to the NDA's definitions, obligations, duration, exclusions, and other related provisions.
6. Determining whether the declarations are semantically entailed by or are inconsistent with the NDA.
----------
17->

1. Examine the alignment and consistency of confidentiality statements and their associated NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) sections. Document any identified inconsistencies or potential violations concerning confidential information, usage, timeframes, and exemptions. Evaluate how the confidentiality obligations in the statements correspond to the defined NDA responsibilities for data usage, sharing, and safeguarding.
----------

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis integrating expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), meticulously scrutinizing methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Provide expert analyses on individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring these analyses are evidence-based, corroborated by CTR data, and aligned with the given descriptions. Rigorously evaluate the logical correlations between expert commentary and CTR excerpts, verifying that assertions are evidence-based, CTR-supported, and congruent with the descriptions, devoid of contradictions.
----------
2->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis linking expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Thoroughly scrutinize the methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse reactions detailed in the CTRs. Accurately depict expert evaluations concerning individual or comparative CTRs, grounded in CTR data and in agreement with the given descriptions. Rigorously confirm the logical relationships between expert opinions and CTR extracts, ensuring all claims are substantiated by evidence from the CTR and are consistent with the provided descriptions.
----------
3->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis by amalgamating expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Examine in detail the methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Offer expert evaluations for individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring analyses are evidence-based, substantiated by CTR data, and consistent with the provided descriptions. Thoroughly assess the logical connections between expert insights and CTR extracts, confirming that statements are evidence-based, supported by CTR data, and in agreement with the descriptions, without any discrepancies.
----------
4->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis, integrating expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Examine in detail the methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse reactions as presented in the CTRs. Precise representation of expert assessments for individual or comparative CTRs is required, based on CTR data, and must align with the provided descriptions. Rigorously validate the logical connections between expert opinions and CTR content, ensuring all assertions are evidence-based from the CTR and consistent with the provided descriptions.

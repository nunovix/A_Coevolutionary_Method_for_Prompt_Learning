0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.

1->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
2->The objective is to examine semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements articulated by clinical domain experts. CTRs elaborate on the procedures and findings of clinical trials, scrutinizing the effectiveness and safety of novel treatments. Each trial involves cohorts or arms exposed to distinct treatments or exhibiting diverse baseline characteristics. Comprehensive CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA delineating conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION particulars specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary encompassing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS cataloging signs and symptoms observed. Statements posit claims regarding the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or in comparative analysis of two. To establish entailment, the statement's assertion should harmonize with clinical trial data, find substantiation in the CTR, and avoid contradiction with the provided descriptions.

"Divide Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) into four main parts: (1) Participant Eligibility Criteria, (2) Detailed Treatment Plans specifying treatment type, dosage, administration frequency, and duration of the trial, (3) Summary of Findings including participant demographics, measured outcomes, units of measurement, and final insights, and (4) Recorded Side Effects cataloging any adverse reactions. Confirm the correctness and understandability of each part by comparing CTD information, content, and descriptions, making sure they align with actual clinical trial data, are supported by the CTD, and do not contain any inconsistencies. Furthermore, evaluate the connection between sections in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative comments on trial methods and results, with a particular emphasis on the effectiveness and safety of treatments."

Perform an in-depth analysis of Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), segmenting them into four key components: (1) Participant Inclusion/Eligibility Criteria, (2) Treatment Protocols/Intervention Details, (3) Participant Outcomes/Results Summary, and (4) Documented Adverse Events/Side Effects. Confirm the internal coherence of statements within CTDs and CTRs by cross-referencing with clinical trial data, ensuring all statements are corroborated within the documents and free from inconsistencies with the provided descriptions. Additionally, evaluate semantic entailment relationships between sections of CTDs and CTRs and established clinical trial procedure and findings statements, with an emphasis on evaluating treatment efficacy and safety.

5->

Analyze Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs/CTRs) by breaking them down into four main parts: (1) Eligibility/Eligibility Criteria, (2) Treatment/Intervention specifics, (3) Results/Results summary, and (4) Adverse Reactions/ADVERSE EVENTS. Confirm statements by cross-checking CTD/CTR details, content, and descriptions for alignment with clinical trial data, support within the document, and absence of contradictions. Additionally, assess semantic entailment between CTR sections and expert statements on trial procedures and findings, focusing on treatment efficacy and safety.
----------
6->

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports by:

1. Identifying Participant Eligibility Criteria,

2. Detailing Treatment Information (type, dosage, frequency, trial duration),

3. Summarizing Results (participant numbers, outcome measures, units, conclusions),

4. Cataloging Adverse Events (observed side effects),

5. Verify statement accuracy by cross-referencing with CTR specifics, content, and descriptions,

6. Confirm alignment with clinical trial data, CTR, and provided information,

7. Evaluate semantic links between CTR sections and medical expertise on trial procedures and findings, focusing on treatment effectiveness and safety.
----------

Perform an exhaustive dissection of Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), categorizing them into four core elements: (1) Eligibility Criteria and ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA for participant inclusion, (2) Treatment Protocols and INTERVENTION specifics, detailing intervention types, dosages, frequencies, and trial durations, (3) Results Summary and RESULTS, encompassing participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and trial conclusions, and (4) Adverse Reactions and ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed side effects. Confirm the accuracy of statements by cross-referencing CTD and CTR details, content, and descriptions, ensuring alignment with clinical trial data, substantiation within the documents, and absence of contradictions. Additionally, evaluate semantic entailment between CTR sections and expert-defined statements on clinical trial procedures and findings, focusing on treatment efficacy and safety assessment.

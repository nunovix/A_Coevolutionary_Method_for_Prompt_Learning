CTRs offer comprehensive insights into clinical trials, encompassing the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. These reports are structured into four primary components: (1) who is qualified, (2) how the treatment functions, (3) the outcomes of the trial, and (4) any adverse reactions. The statements within CTRs explicitly state the information in these sections, either for a single report or for comparative analyses between multiple reports.

0->Analyze the semantic entailment between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical domain specialists. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and results of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapies. Statements, conversely, posit assertions about particular sections of CTRs pertaining to a singular CTR or contrasting two CTRs. Validate entailment by ensuring the statement's claim is corroborated by the CTR data and does not conflict with any given descriptions.

2->Analyze the semantic entailment between individual segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-issued assertions pertaining to specific CTR sections or comparative analyses of multiple CTRs. CTRs encapsulate clinical trial methodologies and outcomes, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapies. Expert assertions should corroborate with CTR data, affirming claims without conflicting with the given descriptions.
----------
3->Evaluate the semantic entailment between different segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and claims made by clinical domain experts. CTRs document the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of innovative treatments. Confirm entailment by verifying that the expert's claim is supported by the CTR data and does not contradict any provided descriptions.

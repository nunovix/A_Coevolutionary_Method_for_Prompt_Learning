0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Evaluate the validity of health-related assertions derived from individual parts of Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs). These documents provide insights into the efficacy and safety of experimental therapies. CTDs are divided into four key segments: (1) PARTICIPANT CRITERIA outlining eligibility for trial involvement, (2) THERAPY DETAILS describing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and length, (3) STUDY RESULTS summarizing participant data, outcome metrics, measurement units, and findings, and (4) SIDE EFFECTS cataloging any unforeseen adverse reactions. Assertions may pertain to a single CTD or contrast findings between two.

2->Evaluate the validity of medical claims based on the content found in individual parts of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). These reports provide insights into the efficacy and safety of experimental therapies. A typical CTR is divided into four segments: (1) PARTICIPANT CRITERIA outlining eligibility for trial enrollment, (2) THERAPY DETAILS describing the intervention's nature, dosage, frequency, and length, (3) STUDY RESULTS summarizing participant demographics, outcome metrics, measurement units, and inferences, and (4) SIDE EFFECTS documenting any unforeseen adverse reactions. Assess whether statements are accurate reflections of data from a single CTR or a comparison between two.
----------
3->Assess the credibility of health-related assertions based on information from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Clinical Trial Reports are detailed documents that describe the process, results, and significance for the safety and effectiveness of novel medical treatments. These reports are divided into four key parts: (1) Participant Selection Criteria, which specifies the requirements for joining the study, (2) Intervention Details, which covers the nature, amount, frequency, and length of the treatment, (3) Findings Overview, summarizing participant characteristics, outcome metrics, measurement units, and the study's "
----------
4->Critically evaluate the validity of health-related statements by examining relevant excerpts from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs). These documents provide insights into the efficacy and safety of new medical treatments. Assess whether the claims are based on data from a single CTR/CTD or from a synthesis of multiple CTRs/CTDs. Focus on key sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Treatment Protocol, (3) Results Summary, (4) Adverse Events for CTRs, and (5) PARTICIPANT CRITERIA, (6) THERAPY DETAILS, (7) STUDY RESULTS, and (8) SIDE EFFECTS for CTDs.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Conduct an in-depth semantic entailment or support analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. Your focus should be on patient eligibility criteria, detailed intervention specifics including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, comprehensive results encompassing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, as well as documented adverse events with observed signs and symptoms. Maintain strict consistency with CTR content, evidence-based support, and adherence to provided descriptions for a thorough comparative evaluation. Pay particular attention to methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

2->Perform an in-depth semantic entailment or support analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions, scrutinizing patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, duration), detailed results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, conclusions), and adverse events (observed signs and symptoms). Confirm the congruence of these elements with expert claims, ensuring strict correspondence with CTR content, evidence-based support, and adherence to provided descriptions for a thorough comparative evaluation. Pay particular attention to methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

3->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and domain-specific clinical assertions, meticulously examining patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), detailed results (encompassing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (noting observed signs and symptoms). Uphold methodological precision, evidence-based consistency, and rigorous compliance with the provided descriptions for an exhaustive comparative assessment, emphasizing methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions, meticulously examining patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), detailed results (encompassing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), as well as adverse events (identifying observed signs and symptoms). Ensure strict congruence between these elements and expert claims, verifying consistency with CTR content, evidence-based support, and adherence to provided descriptions for a thorough comparative evaluation. Pay particular attention to methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->Evaluate semantic entailment between clinical domain experts' assertions and individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Analyze the correlation between methodologies, results, and treatment assessments within CTRs and expert statements. Ensure these evaluations are consistent with clinical data, find support within CTRs, and avoid contradictions.
----------
2->Evaluate semantic entailment between expert claims and Clinical Trial Reports sections, meticulously analyzing methodologies, results, and treatment efficacy and safety. Confirm alignment across multiple CTRs or expert opinions, corroborating with clinical data to ensure accuracy and avoid contradictions, while upholding consistency with original intent.
----------
3->Evaluate the semantic and inferential relationships between expert statements and Clinical Trial Report (CTR) extracts. Conduct a critical analysis of the methods, outcomes, and safety/efficacy assertions associated with novel therapies. Confirm the validity of these assertions across several CTRs or expert statements, aligning with clinical data to avoid discrepancies.

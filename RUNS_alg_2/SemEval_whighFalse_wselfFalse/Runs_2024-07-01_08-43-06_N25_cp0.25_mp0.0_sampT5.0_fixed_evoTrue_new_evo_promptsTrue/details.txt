Total elapsed time: 4:24:16.109450
No. of iterations: 17
Average time per iteration: 0:15:32.712321

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 25
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 5
Max no. of iterations allowed: 200
Patience: 10
Evaluation done on: dev set
With 200 examples

Name of the model used: microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
Retrieving examples-->False 
Alg 2 - Random sample 2 individuals weighted on scores, apply crossover and mutation to the offspring, top 5 performers are always kept as elite population
With crossover probability 0.25 and mutation probability 0.0

1->

A Clinical Trial Report should comprise the following sections, each with comprehensive explanations:

1. Study Design: Elaboration on the study's research strategy, including study category (interventional or observational), randomization technique (allocation method), and masking arrangement (blinding scheme) to minimize potential biases.
2. Methodology: Exposition of participant selection procedures, sample size calculations, data gathering techniques, chosen statistical methods, and adhered data collection guidelines.
3. Results: Presentation of participants' demographic data, primary trial results, and statistical analysis results.
4. Discussion: Analysis and interpretation of the study's findings, evaluation of their relevance to current knowledge, and comparisons with previous research.

A Clinical Trial Report should include the following sections with detailed explanations:

1. Study Design: Description of the research design, including study category (interventional or observational), randomization process (participant allocation strategy), and masking approach (method to conceal information from study participants and researchers).
2. Methodology: Explanation of participant selection (criteria for choosing study subjects), sample size estimation (determination of the necessary number of participants), data acquisition techniques (procedures for obtaining data), statistical analysis approaches (methods for analyzing data), and implementation of standardized data collection procedures.
3. Results: Reporting of participant demographics (descriptive statistics about the study population), trial endpoints (primary objectives of the study), and statistical analysis outcomes (results of the data analysis).
4. Discussion: Interpretation of study findings (evaluation of the study's significance and implications), compar

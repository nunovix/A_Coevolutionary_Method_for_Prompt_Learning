0->Evaluate the credibility of health-related claims from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Critically analyze the four essential sections of a CTR: (1) Participant Inclusion Criteria, (2) Treatment Details, including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Participant Outcomes, summarizing demographics, results, measurements, and observations, and (4) Recorded Adverse Events, noting any negative reactions. Use data from a single Clinical Trial Report or compare two to ensure a comprehensive and unambiguous assessment for medical professionals.

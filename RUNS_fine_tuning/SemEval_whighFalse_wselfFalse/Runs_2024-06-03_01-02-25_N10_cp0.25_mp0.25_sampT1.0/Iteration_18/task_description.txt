Perform a semantic entailment analysis correlating segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with evidence-based statements from clinical domain experts, specifically assessing new pharmaceuticals' efficacy and safety. Verify that each expert's statement aligns directly with data from CTRs and maintains consistency with the original descriptions, avoiding contradictions. This analysis should include individual CTR sections and comparative evaluations across various reports.

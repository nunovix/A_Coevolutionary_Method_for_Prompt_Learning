0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Execute an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis by amalgamating authoritative medical expertise with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Critically evaluate methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Offer expert evaluations for individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring analyses are evidence-based, substantiated by CTR data, and consistent with provided descriptions. Rigorously assess the logical correlations between expert insights and CTR specifics, verifying that all assertions are evidence-based, CTR-supported, congruent with descriptions, and free from contradictions.

2->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis by merging authoritative medical expertise with details from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Critically assess methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Provide expert evaluations for individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring analyses are evidence-based, substantiated by CTR data, and consistent with provided descriptions. Rigorously evaluate the logical connections between expert insights and CTR specifics, verifying that all assertions are evidence-based, CTR-supported, congruent with descriptions, and free from contradictions.

4->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis by integrating authoritative medical expertise with intricate details from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Analyze methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety profiles, participant selection criteria, trial protocols, outcomes, and adverse reactions as specified in the CTRs. Provide expert-level evaluations for individual or comparative CTRs, backed by data from the CTRs and strictly complying with the given descriptions. Verify rigorously the logical connections between expert assessments and CTR content, ensuring all statements are evidence-based, consistent with the descriptions, and devoid of contradictions.

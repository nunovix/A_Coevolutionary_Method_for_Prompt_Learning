0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts, ensuring the claim aligns with clinical trial information.
----------
2->Determine the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: eligibility criteria, intervention description, results summary, and adverse event listing. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two. Ensure the claim is related to clinical trial information, supported by the CTR, and does not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
3->Assess semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Ensure statements are supported by CTR information, do not contradict provided descriptions, and make claims related to clinical trial information, supporting a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.

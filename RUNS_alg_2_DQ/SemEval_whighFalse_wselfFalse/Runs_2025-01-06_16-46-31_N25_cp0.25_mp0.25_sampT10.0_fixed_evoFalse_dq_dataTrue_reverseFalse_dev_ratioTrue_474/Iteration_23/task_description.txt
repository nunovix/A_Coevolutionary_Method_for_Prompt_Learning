0->Determine semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. This involves analyzing CTRs, which consist of four sections: eligibility criteria, intervention, results, and adverse events. Statements are sentences that make claims about the information in these sections. To establish an entailment relationship, the claim must be related to the CTR information, supported by the CTR, and not contradict the provided descriptions.

1->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. A complete CTR contains 4 sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of these sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. To establish an entailment relationship, the claim in the statement must be related to the CTR information, supported by the CTR, and not contradict the provided descriptions.

2->Determine semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. A CTR consists of four sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Statements make claims about the information in one or more CTR sections. To establish an entailment relationship, the claim must be related to the CTR information, supported by the CTR, and not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
3->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to identify semantic entailment relationships between statements made by clinical domain experts and individual sections of the reports. Evaluate CTR sections (eligibility, treatment, outcomes, and side effects) to determine if expert assertions support or contradict the provided descriptions, and if the assertions are linked to the CTR information.

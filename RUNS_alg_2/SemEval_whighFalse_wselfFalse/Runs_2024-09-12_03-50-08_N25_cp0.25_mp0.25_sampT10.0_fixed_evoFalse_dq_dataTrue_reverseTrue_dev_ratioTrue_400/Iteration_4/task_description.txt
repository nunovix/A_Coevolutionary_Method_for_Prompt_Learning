0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

4->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the validity of clinical statements regarding patient eligibility, intervention specifics, results, and adverse events. CTRs are structured into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, presenting participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and final conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any unexpected adverse reactions. Assess the accuracy and relevance of statements that pertain to any single CTR or compare findings across multiple reports.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, emphasizing eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, trial outcomes, and adverse event documentation. For each CTR, meticulously examine the patient inclusion criteria, treatment specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), participant results, measurement units, conclusions, and adverse events. Verify that corresponding expert clinical statements corroborate the CTR content, substantiate claims with evidence, and match exactly with detailed trial descriptions.
----------
2->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, concentrating on eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, trial outcomes, and adverse events. Break down each CTR into four distinct sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, specifying patient inclusion parameters, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment specifics including type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) RESULTS, enumerating participant numbers, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and principal findings, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed patient signs and symptoms. Verify that expert clinical statements are precisely reflected in these sections within a single CTR or across multiple CTRs. Confirm entailment by ensuring the statement is consistent with CTR content, substantiates the claim, and aligns with the provided descriptions.

3->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between discrete segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical specialists. CTRs detail the procedures and results of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. The assertions, conversely, make specific claims about information contained within sections of a single CTR or between two CTRs for comparative analysis. For entailment verification, ensure the claim is consistent with the clinical trial data, substantiated by the CTR, and does not conflict with the given descriptions.

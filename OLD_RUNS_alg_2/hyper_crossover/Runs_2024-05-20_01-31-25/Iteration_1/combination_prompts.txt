0->Consider the problem of combining two different textual instructions, pertaining to the same task. The objective is to rephrase the main information common to the two descriptions, while keeping their meaning and intent. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The combined instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The combined instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instructions. Considering the aforementioned task description, combine the two textual instructions shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.
----------
1->Rephrase and synthesize two distinct textual instructions related to a task, ensuring the fusion captures the essence of both while potentially expanding for increased clarity and expertise. Strive for an instruction that concisely guides experts in executing the task more effectively than the original instructions.
----------
2->Reframe the essence of two distinct textual instructions, related to the same task, to create a singular, expert-level directive. This synthesized instruction should encapsulate the shared core information between the instructions while maintaining their original meanings and purposes. It may adopt a succinct or expanded format to better elucidate the task at hand, and avoid inaccuracies at all costs. Strive for clarity and precision, offering a more instructionally lucid rendition than the original versions.
----------
3->Rephrase and integrate two separate textual instructions on the same task into a single, clear, and comprehensive instruction, incorporating all essential details from both. Ensure the merged instruction retains the original intent and information.
----------
4->Transform the initial two instructions into one, articulating a complex directive that amalgamates the core message of both. Whether aiming for brevity, you should distill the principal ideas with precision, or for thoroughness, elaborate on explanations and definitions to boost understanding. Ensure the final directive exceeds in clarity and straightforwardness over the originals while preserving their fundamental objectives and intent.

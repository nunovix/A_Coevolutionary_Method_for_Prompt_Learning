0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis correlating expert assertions with detailed segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Execute singular and comparative analyses, substantiated by pertinent excerpts from CTRs. Validate that these analyses uphold the initial expert claims, maintaining coherence and eliminating contradictions.

----------
3->Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between expert assertions and specific segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), scrutinizing ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. This should encompass both singular and comparative evaluations to verify that expert claims are congruent with clinical trial data, evidenced by pertinent CTR excerpts. Ensure these analyses corroborate, reinforce, and maintain consistency with the initial expert claims, avoiding any contradictions.

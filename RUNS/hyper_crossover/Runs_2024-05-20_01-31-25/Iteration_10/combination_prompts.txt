0->Consider the problem of combining two different textual instructions, pertaining to the same task. The objective is to rephrase the main information common to the two descriptions, while keeping their meaning and intent. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The combined instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The combined instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instructions. Considering the aforementioned task description, combine the two textual instructions shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.
----------
1->"Compose two advanced-level detailed textual instructions that convey the same fundamental task, meticulously preserving the original purpose and message. The revised instructions may be concise or expanded with precise definitions and further explanation. Ensure accuracy and prioritize clarity in the instructions compared to the initial versions."
----------
2->Rephrase and integrate the essential elements from two separate instructions regarding the same task, ensuring the essence and purpose remain intact for an expert audience. Create a synthesized directive that can be succinctly summarized or expanded with additional explanations and definitions for clarity. Aim for explicit and direct instructions in conveying the task, surpassing the clarity of the originals.
----------
3->Create an advanced tutorial that distills and clarifies the main points and critical components from the original set of instructions. Preserve the original purpose, key elements, and necessary accuracy, improving the initial instructions for better clarity and detail. Targeted at informed audiences, the tutorial should ensure high precision, providing a detailed and accurate summary or extensive analysis of the central task to deepen instruction comprehension.
----------
4->Transform and consolidate the fundamental details from two separate textual instructions that pertain to the same subject, ensuring the retention of their core intent and objective. This revised guideline should be designed for an expert audience, possibly serving as a brief synopsis or an elaborate, comprehensive version of the instructions, free from errors. Aim for clarity and straightforwardness in describing how to perform the task, surpassing the original instructions in informative quality.

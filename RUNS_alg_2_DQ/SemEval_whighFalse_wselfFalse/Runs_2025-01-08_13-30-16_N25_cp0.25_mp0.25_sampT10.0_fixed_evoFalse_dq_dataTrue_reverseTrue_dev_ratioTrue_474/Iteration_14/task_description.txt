0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Trials involve patient groups, called cohorts or arms, which may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. A complete CTR contains 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
1->To establish semantic entailment relationships between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, analyze the four main sections of a CTR: eligibility criteria, intervention details, results summaries, and adverse event listings. Expert statements should make claims about specific CTR sections, supported by the underlying data, and align with the provided descriptions.

2->Determine semantic entailment relations between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical experts. A CTR consists of four sections: eligibility criteria, intervention details, results summary, and adverse events. Statements (claims) relate to one or more CTR sections, are supported by the CTR, and do not contradict its descriptions.

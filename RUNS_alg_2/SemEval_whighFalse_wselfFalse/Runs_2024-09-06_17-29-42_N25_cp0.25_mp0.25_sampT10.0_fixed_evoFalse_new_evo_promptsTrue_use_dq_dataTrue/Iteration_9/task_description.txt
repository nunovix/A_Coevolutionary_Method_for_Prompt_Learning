0->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for semantic entailment, ensuring expert statements align with the CTRs' sections on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS, maintaining consistency when comparing statements from different CTRs.
----------
1->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for semantic entailment, ensuring that expert statements are consistent with the CTRs' sections on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. When comparing statements from different CTRs, verify that they do not contradict the provided descriptions. Clinical Trial Reports detail the procedures and findings of clinical trials, which are organized into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA that outline the conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION that describe the treatments administered to different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS that summarize participant statistics and the outcomes of the trial, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS that list any observed signs and symptoms experienced by the participants. Ensure that expert claims about the information within these sections are supported by the CTRs and are not in conflict with each other.
----------
2->Examine Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify that expert commentary on PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS, TREATMENT PROCEDURES, STUDY OUTCOMES, PARTICIPANT SIDE EFFECTS, ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS are congruent across documents, ensuring no contradictory expert interpretations exist.
----------
3->Conduct an in-depth analysis of Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to ensure that expert commentary on PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS, TREATMENT PROCEDURES, STUDY OUTCOMES, PARTICIPANT SIDE EFFECTS, ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS are coherent and consistent across all documents. Verify that there are no contradictory interpretations among experts regarding these key aspects of the clinical trials.
----------
4->Review Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to ensure expert commentary on PARTICIPANT CRITERIA, TREATMENTS, OUTCOMES, and PARTICIPANT SIDE EFFECTS is consistent across documents, verifying no contradictory interpretations exist.
----------
5->Examine Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) for coherence, ensuring that expert analyses are consistent with the CTDs' sections on Participant Criteria, Treatments, Outcomes, and Participant Side Effects. Verify that interpretations across different CTDs are congruent with the documented content. Clinical Trial Documents detail the methods and findings of clinical trials, divided into four key areas: (1) Participant Criteria outlining eligibility requirements, (2) Treatments describing administered interventions, (3) Outcomes summarizing participant data and trial results, and (4) Participant Side Effects listing observed adverse reactions. Confirm that expert commentary aligns with the CTDs and avoids contradictions.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Execute a detailed semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions, focusing on patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, and duration), comprehensive results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (noting observed signs and symptoms). Ensure methodological precision, evidence-based consistency, and strict adherence to provided descriptions for an exhaustive comparative assessment, with emphasis on methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

2->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims, concentrating on patient eligibility, intervention specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), detailed results (encompassing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and recorded adverse events (detailing observed signs and symptoms). Maintain rigorous alignment with CTR content, evidence-based support, and explicit descriptions for a thorough comparative assessment. Highlight methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

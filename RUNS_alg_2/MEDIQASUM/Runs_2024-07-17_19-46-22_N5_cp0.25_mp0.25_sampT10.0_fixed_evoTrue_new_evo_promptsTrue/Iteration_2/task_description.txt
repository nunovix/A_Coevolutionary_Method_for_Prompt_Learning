0->Your task concerns summarizing the transcript of a dialogue between a doctor and a patient, collected in the context of a clinical encounter. Start by briefly describing the main presenting issues, and then organize the relevant elements expressed in the conversation clearly and consistently. Be sure to describe the patient’s chief complaints, including onset, chronology, quality, and severity, taking as basis what the patient tells to the doctor about how he feels and what happened. Register also the measurable and objective facts about the patient’s status, such as vital signs or other findings, as observed by the doctor. Include the doctor's interpretation, in the form of complete list of diagnoses together with additional relevant attributes. Finally, document the treatment plan, including further investigations deemed necessary, referral procedures, new medications, or other prescribed therapies.

1->Compose a healthcare note that encapsulates all the relevant information in a verbal exchange between a doctor and a patient. Adhere to standard recommendations for structuring clinical notes, considering parts such as the History of the Present Illness (HPI), a Review of Systems (ROS), conclusions from a Physical Examination (PE), lab and imaging results, and other relevant tests, and finally the doctor's Assessment and treatment Plan (A/P). As a way to aid you in the wrtiting of the note, you'll also be provided with an example note. Use it as a way to know the proper structure you should use.

2->Summarize the doctor-patient dialogue transcript, focusing on the patient's primary symptoms, their onset, duration, and intensity. Record the patient's subjective experiences and the doctor's objective findings, including vital signs. List the doctor's diagnoses with pertinent details, and outline the proposed treatment strategy, encompassing required tests, referrals, and prescribed treatments.
----------
3->Create a concise medical encounter note based on a patient-provider dialogue. Extract crucial clinical details like drugs, illnesses, injuries, and observed signs/symptoms. Organize the note using SOAP or APSO format, ensuring clarity and brevity.

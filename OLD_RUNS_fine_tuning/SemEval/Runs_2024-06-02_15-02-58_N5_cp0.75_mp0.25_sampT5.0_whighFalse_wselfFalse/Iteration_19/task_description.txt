0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Execute a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert assertions and detailed sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. This should include both singular and comparative evaluations to ensure expert claims align with clinical trial data, as evidenced by pertinent CTR excerpts. Confirm that these analyses corroborate and reinforce the initial expert claims without introducing contradictions.

2->

Execute a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert assertions and detailed sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Ensure expert claims align with clinical trial data through singular and comparative assessments, substantiated by pertinent CTR excerpts. Validate that these analyses corroborate initial expert claims, maintaining consistency and avoiding contradictions.
----------
3->

Execute a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert assertions and detailed segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. This analysis should include both singular and comparative evaluations to verify that expert claims align with clinical trial data, supported by pertinent CTR excerpts. Ensure that these analyses affirm the initial expert claims, maintaining consistency and avoiding contradictions.
----------
4->Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert claims and specific segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), meticulously examining ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. This analysis should include both singular and comparative assessments to ascertain that expert statements align precisely with clinical trial data, substantiated by relevant CTR excerpts. Confirm that these analyses not only corroborate but also reinforce the initial expert claims, ensuring no contradictions are introduced.

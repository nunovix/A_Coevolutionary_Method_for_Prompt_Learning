0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.

1->Determine the semantic entailment relationships between specific sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and claims made by clinical domain experts. The CTRs describe the clinical trial procedures and findings aimed at evaluating new treatment effectiveness and safety. Each trial encompasses one to two patient groups, cohorts, with varied treatments or baseline characteristics. CTRs consist of four distinct sections: (1) eligibility criteria defining patient inclusion for trial participation, (2) intervention details outlining treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) results summary, detailing participant count, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) adverse events log, documenting observed patient signs and symptoms. Statements made by experts are to be considered, and claims should relate to one or both of the CTRs without contradicting the trial descriptions.

In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
3->Identify the entailment relationships between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative expert claims, specifically targeting treatment efficacy and safety assessments. Examine CTRs featuring cohorts of 1-2 patients undergoing various treatments or control conditions. Analyze the following four components: (1) Eligibility Criteria, defining patient inclusion conditions, (2) Intervention details, outlining treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Results, including participant count, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) Adverse Events, recording observed patient symptoms. Determine entailment strictly in relation to these components within individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring statements are coherent, substantiated, and non-contradictory.
----------
4->Determine semantic entailment relations between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) sections and expert statements, focusing on methodology, findings, eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Analyze each CTR's 4 sections to draw connections with claims made by experts, ensuring these claims are related to trial information, supported by the CTR without contradiction.

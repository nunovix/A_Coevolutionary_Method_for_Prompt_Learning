0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->s nature, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and the study
----------
2->Determine the support for clinical statements within Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by extracting relevant information from the following sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS.
----------
3->Conduct a thorough examination of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by:

1. Verifying participant eligibility based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
2. Detailing the specifics of the intervention, including the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of the treatment.
3. Summarizing the demographics of the participants, the outcome measures used, the units of measurement, and the final conclusions drawn from the data.
4. Recording any adverse events that occurred during the trial to assess the treatment's safety profile.

RESULT:

The rephrased instruction provides a clear and structured approach to evaluating the effectiveness and safety of new treatments through Clinical Trial Reports. By breaking down the task into specific, actionable steps, it ensures a comprehensive analysis that covers all necessary aspects of the clinical trial process.
----------
4->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the validity of clinical statements regarding patient eligibility, intervention specifics (including dosage, frequency, and duration), results (encompassing participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and final conclusions), and adverse events. Assess the accuracy and relevance of statements that pertain to any single CTR or compare findings across multiple reports.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->Analyze semantic entailment relationships between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, focusing on methodology, findings, eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Each CTR, involving 1-2 patient cohorts, assesses new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Statements, made by clinical experts, must align with CTR information, be substantiated by the reports, and remain consistent with provided descriptions to establish entailment.
----------
2->

Analyze semantic entailment relationships between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative declarations. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and findings of clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. These reports are segmented into four distinct parts: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which specifies the inclusion conditions for patients, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the nature, dosage, frequency, and length of treatment, (3) RESULTS, summarizing the number of participants, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms in patients. Authoritative declarations assert information contained within these segments for individual or comparative analyses of CTRs. Establish entailment by ensuring the declaration is substantiated by the CTR, is consistent with the descriptions, and does not contradict them.

3->

Determine the semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. Analyze CTRs, which detail clinical trial methodologies and findings, to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs comprise four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining patient participation conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, specifying treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Expert statements should support, not contradict, information from these sections, either for a single CTR or in comparative analyses between two CTRs.
----------
4->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Assess semantic entailment between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert claims, focusing on methodology, results, treatment efficacy, and safety assessments. Ensure the expert claim is consistent with the CTR content, corroborates the CTR without contradiction, and pertains to either a single CTR or a comparative analysis of two CTRs. Verify that comprehensive CTRs include ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION details, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS, with expert claims accurately reflecting data from these sections.

2->

Examine the semantic entailment relationships between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert assertions. CTRs document clinical trials assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety, divided into four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, specifying treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, recording observed signs and symptoms. Analyze expert claims related to these sections for singular or comparative CTR analyses. Confirm entailment by ensuring the claim aligns with CTR data, is supported by the report, and does not contradict the provided descriptions.

3->

Analyze the semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert claims. CTRs record clinical trials, evaluating new treatments' efficacy and safety. The reports are divided into four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, describing patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Expert claims pertain to data within these sections for a singular or comparative analysis of two CTRs. To confirm entailment, verify that the claim is consistent with clinical trial data, is supported by the CTR, and does not conflict with the provided descriptions.

4->Your objective is to discern semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical experts. To establish entailment, ensure that the expert's claim is substantiated by the CTR content and does not contradict it. CTRs provide detailed insights into clinical trial methodologies and outcomes, assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Comprising four sections, CTRs include: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA outlining patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS documenting observed signs and symptoms. Statements pertain to these sections, either for a single CTR or in comparative analyses between two CTRs.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.

1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. CTRs, comprising clinical trial procedures of clinical trial outcomes, are divided sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA defining patient inclusion conditions, 2) INTERVENTION describing treatment outcomes, 3) RESULTS summarizing participant statistics and outcomes, and 4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Expert_statements make claims about these sections, either for a single CTR or in a comparative analysis of two CTRs. To establish entailment, statementsions must align with CTR information, not contradicting any provided descriptions.

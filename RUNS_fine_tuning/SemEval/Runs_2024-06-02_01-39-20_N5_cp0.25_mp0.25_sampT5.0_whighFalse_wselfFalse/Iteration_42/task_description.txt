Conduct a comprehensive review of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), scrutinizing four pivotal components: (1) Participant Eligibility Criteria, including inclusion and exclusion parameters, (2) Intervention Details, specifying intervention type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment length, (3) Trial Results, capturing participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and trial findings, and (4) Documented Adverse Events, recording any observed signs and symptoms. Verify clinical claims with data extracted from CTRs, ensuring consistency with expert opinions and avoiding discrepancies with CTR content. Apply this analysis to a single CTR or compare two CTRs.

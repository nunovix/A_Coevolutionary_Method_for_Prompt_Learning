0->Consider how to combine two separate textual instructions for the same task. The primary objective is to rephrase the main information that is common to both descriptions, using different words and changing the ordering of the statements, while ensuring that their meaning and intent remain intact. It is important to include all relevant details from both instructions, regardless of whether this makes the final instruction longer. The resulting instruction should be clear, comprehensive, and informative, providing a thorough guide for task execution. This means paying attention to nuances and specific details in both texts, integrating them seamlessly to produce a unified directive that leaves no room for ambiguity. The final instruction should be detailed enough to cater to experts in the field, ensuring they have all the information needed to perform the task efficiently.

1->You are tasked with merging two different instructions that aim at the same objective. You should rephrase the core information that is common to both descriptions, taking the best ideas from each and building upon them to enhance clarity (e.g., by replacing words, deleting irrelevant parts, or changing the ordering of the statements). You have the freedom to add further explanations and clarifications where necessary, as long as the final instruction remains clear, comprehensive, easy to follow, and true to the original intent. The goal is to create a combined instruction that not only preserves the essential information from both descriptions, but also improves upon it, making it easier for experts in the field to execute the task accurately and efficiently.
----------
2->Synthesize the essential elements from both provided directions, ensuring a clear, concise, and comprehensive guide for experts to execute the task with confidence and precision. Incorporate the most effective ideas, refine the language for improved clarity, and maintain fidelity to the original objectives. Enhance the instruction with necessary definitions and clarifications to facilitate accurate and efficient task completion.
----------
3->Synthesize the objectives from both original directives, extracting and refining the key elements to form a singular, streamlined directive. Ensure the new instruction maintains fidelity to the original intents while enhancing readability and comprehension for specialists.
----------
4->Synthesize the objectives from the original directives, refining key elements to form a singular, streamlined directive. Maintain fidelity to the original intents while enhancing readability and comprehension for specialists.
----------
5->Synthesize the primary objectives from the provided directives, refining and consolidating key elements into a singular, coherent directive. Ensure the rephrased instruction retains the essence of the original intents, enhancing readability and comprehension for field experts. Integrate the core information from both descriptions, selecting the most effective ideas and expanding upon them to improve clarity. Include additional explanations and clarifications as necessary, ensuring the final instruction remains clear, comprehensive, and straightforward, accurately reflecting the original intent.

0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
2->

Undertake a comprehensive analysis of semantic entailment between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements, with a focus on methodology, treatment efficacy, safety, eligibility and exclusion criteria, treatment specifics, trial outcomes, and adverse event documentation. Ensure expert statements are evidence-based, clinically pertinent, and consistent with CTR details.
----------
3->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-level clinical claims, concentrating on methodology, therapeutic effectiveness, safety profiles, participant inclusion/exclusion parameters, intervention particulars, trial results, and adverse reactions. Dissect CTRs into distinct categories: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention Details, Results, and Adverse Events. Verify that expert assertions are grounded in evidence, clinically pertinent, and align with CTR narratives, ensuring no contradictions with the original descriptions.
----------
4->

Perform a semantic entailment evaluation between expert claims and data extracted from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Analyze CTRs, which document the procedures and results of clinical trials assessing new therapeutic interventions' efficacy and safety. These trials usually encompass one to two groups of patients, each subjected to different treatments or baseline characteristics. The CTRs are segmented into four parts: (1) eligibility criteria for patient inclusion, (2) intervention specifics detailing treatment type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment length, (3) results section summarizing the number of trial participants, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and trial conclusions, and (4) adverse events listing observed patient symptoms throughout the trial. Expert assertions should be cross-referenced with CTR data to validate entailment, ensuring claims are corroborated by CTR details, substantiated, and non-contradictory to the given descriptions.
----------
5->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-level clinical statements, emphasizing methodology, therapeutic efficacy, safety, inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention specifics, trial outcomes, and adverse event data. Break down CTRs into the following components: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Verify that expert statements are grounded in evidence, clinically pertinent, and maintain narrative consistency with CTRs, avoiding any contradictions.
----------
6->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-level clinical statements, emphasizing methodology, therapeutic effectiveness, safety profiles, participant inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention details, trial results, and adverse event reporting. Dissect CTRs into four primary components: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Verify that expert assertions are grounded in evidence, clinically pertinent, and coherent with CTR narratives, ensuring no discrepancies with the original descriptions.
----------
7->

Perform a semantic entailment evaluation between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical assertions. Confirm that the expert assertion is congruent with the CTR content, is corroborated by the CTR data, and remains consistent with the CTR descriptions. Validate entailment for one to two patient cohorts within trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel treatments, as specified in CTRs comprising four sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS.

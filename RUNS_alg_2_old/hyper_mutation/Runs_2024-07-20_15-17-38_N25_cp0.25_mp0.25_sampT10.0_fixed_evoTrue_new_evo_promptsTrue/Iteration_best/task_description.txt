0->Consider the problem of rewriting a textual instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the descriptions by changing the phrasing or the ordering of the explanations, while keeping the exact same meaning. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The rewritten instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The re-written instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instruction.

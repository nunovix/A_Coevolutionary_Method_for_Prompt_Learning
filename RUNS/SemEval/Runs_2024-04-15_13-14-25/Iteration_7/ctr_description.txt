1. Study Design: Description of the experimental plan, including study type (interventional or observational), randomization procedure (process by which participants are assigned to groups), and masking method (blinding scheme to prevent bias).
2. Methodology: Approaches for participant selection (strategy for choosing study participants), sample size calculation (estimation of required number of participants), data collection methods (techniques for gathering data), statistical analysis methods (approaches for analyzing data), and data collection protocols (standardized procedures for collecting and managing data).
3. Results: Presentation of demographic data (information about study participants), trial endpoints (primary outcomes of the study), and statistical analysis findings (results of the data analysis).
4. Discussion: Interpretation of study findings (understanding the implications of the results), comparisons with previous research (evaluating the study in the context of existing knowledge), and potential future research directions.

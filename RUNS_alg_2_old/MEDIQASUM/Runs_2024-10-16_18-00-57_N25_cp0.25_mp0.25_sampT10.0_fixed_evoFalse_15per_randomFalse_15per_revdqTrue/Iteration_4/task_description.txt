0->Consider the task of writing a clinical note summarizing a conversation between a doctor and patient. The note should be structured into 4 sections: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, PHYSICAL EXAM, RESULTS, ASSESSMENT AND PLAN. Be as accurate as possible in the summarization, attending to clinical concepts that are identified as present or absent in the transcription of the conversation.
----------
1->Draft a medical note for an encounter between a healthcare provider and a patient. Attend to the most relevant information from a transcript of the conversation, identifying key clinical concepts such as medications, diseases, conditions, injuries, signs and symptoms. Structure the note according to standard formats, such as SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) or APSO (assessment, plan, subjective, objective). Be thorough, clear, and brief. You'll also be provided with an example note so you can know the structure we are looking for in the note.
----------
2->Compile a clinical note with sections on History of Present Illness, Physical Examination, Results, and Assessment and Plan, reflecting the dialogue's clinical details accurately.
----------
3->Compile a concise and comprehensive clinical note from a patient-doctor dialogue, capturing the essence of the encounter. Begin with the patient's chief complaints, detailing the symptoms' onset, duration, character, and intensity as narrated by the patient. Follow with objective findings, including vital signs and physical examination results. Summarize the doctor's assessment, listing all diagnoses with pertinent details. Conclude with the proposed treatment plan, outlining necessary tests, referrals, medications, or therapies. Format the note according to SOAP or APSO standards for clarity and brevity.
----------
4->Craft a detailed and succinct clinical note from a patient-doctor interaction, ensuring it encapsulates the key elements of the dialogue. Start by documenting the patient's primary complaints, elaborating on the symptoms' initiation, persistence, nature, and severity based on the patient's account. Proceed to record objective data, such as vital signs and findings from the physical examination. Summarize the healthcare provider's evaluation, enumerating all potential diagnoses with relevant specifics. Conclude with the suggested management strategy, detailing required diagnostic tests, referrals, pharmaceuticals, or therapeutic interventions. Structure the note in accordance with SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) or APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) guidelines to enhance clarity and conciseness.

RESULT: The rephrased instruction now begins with the patient's chief complaints, includes details about the symptoms' onset, duration, character, and intensity, and follows with objective findings and the doctor's assessment. It concludes with a treatment plan that outlines necessary tests, referrals, medications, or therapies, all formatted according to SOAP or APSO standards for improved clarity and brevity.
----------
5->Compose a concise medical report summarizing a dialogue between a doctor and a patient. Extract crucial medical details like prescribed drugs, illnesses, health issues, traumas, indications, and manifestations. Organize the report using recognized templates like SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) or APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective). Ensure the report is succinct, comprehensible, and precise. An example report will guide you on the desired format.

1->Your task concerns summarizing the transcript of a dialogue between a doctor and a patient, collected in the context of a clinical encounter. Start by briefly describing the main presenting issues, and then organize the relevant elements expressed in the conversation clearly and consistently. Be sure to describe the patient’s chief complaints, including onset, chronology, quality, and severity, taking as basis what the patient tells to the doctor about how he feels and what happened. Register also the measurable and objective facts about the patient’s status, such as vital signs or other findings, as observed by the doctor. Include the doctor's interpretation, in the form of complete list of diagnoses together with additional relevant attributes. Finally, document the treatment plan, including further investigations deemed necessary, referral procedures, new medications, or other prescribed therapies.

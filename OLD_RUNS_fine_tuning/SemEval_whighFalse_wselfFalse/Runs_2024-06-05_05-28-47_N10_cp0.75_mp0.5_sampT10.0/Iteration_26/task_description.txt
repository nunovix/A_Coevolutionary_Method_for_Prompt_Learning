0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Execute an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis by amalgamating authoritative medical expertise with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Critically evaluate methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Offer expert evaluations for individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring analyses are evidence-based, substantiated by CTR data, and consistent with provided descriptions. Rigorously assess the logical correlations between expert insights and CTR specifics, verifying that all assertions are evidence-based, CTR-supported, congruent with descriptions, and free from contradictions.
----------
2->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between discrete segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by specialists in the clinical field. CTRs detail the procedures and results of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. The assertions, conversely, make specific claims about the information contained within one or more sections of CTRs, either for a single report or for a comparative evaluation of multiple reports. To validate entailment, ensure that the assertion is consistent with the clinical trial data, is substantiated by the CTR, and does not conflict with the given descriptions.
----------
3->Conduct an expert-level semantic entailment analysis by correlating authoritative medical expertise with detailed elements from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Examine methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety profiles, participant selection, trial protocols, outcomes, and adverse reactions as detailed in the CTRs. Offer expert evaluations for individual or comparative CTRs, substantiated by CTR data, and ensure strict adherence to the provided descriptions. Rigorously confirm logical connections between expert assessments and CTR content, ensuring all statements are evidence-based, consistent with the descriptions, and free from contradictions.
----------
4->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis by merging authoritative medical expertise with detailed Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Critically assess methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Provide expert evaluations for individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring analyses are evidence-based, substantiated by CTR data, and consistent with provided descriptions. Rigorously evaluate the logical connections between expert insights and CTR specifics, verifying that all assertions are evidence-based, CTR-supported, congruent with descriptions, and free from contradictions.

0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Analyze clinical trial reports (CTRs), which are divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Determine if expert statements about these sections are semantically entailed by the CTRs, ensuring no contradictions are present.
----------
2->Examine Clinical Trial Reports to verify that expert commentary on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections are logically coherent, consistent, and non-contradictory.
----------
3->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for expert insights on (1) Eligibility Criteria for Participants, (2) Specifics of Treatment Protocols, (3) Summarized Data and Conclusions from the Study, and (4) Documented Adverse Events. Ensure clinical statements are consistent across CTR segments, assessing the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs are categorized into 4 sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria for Participants, (2) Treatment Protocols, (3) Study Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Validate that assertions are based on content from one or more CTRs.
----------
4->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Validate expert statements about these sections for semantic entailment, ensuring consistency and absence of contradictions.
----------
5->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for expert analysis on (1) Eligibility Criteria for Participants, (2) Specifics of Treatment Procedures, (3) Summarized Data and Conclusions, and (4) Reported Adverse Events. Verify the accuracy of clinical claims against the content of individual CTR sections. CTRs are categorized into 4 segments: (1) Eligibility Criteria for Participants, (2) Treatment Procedures, (3) Summarized Data and Conclusions, and (4) Reported Adverse Events. Ensure assertions are based on information from one or more CTRs.

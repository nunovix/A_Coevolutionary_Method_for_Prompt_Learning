0->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.
----------
1->Establish semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations, focusing on key terms such as confidential information, party obligations, and exclusions to determine supported or contradicted statements.
----------
2->You are required to analyze the connections between parts of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements regarding confidentiality commitments. NDAs outline the guidelines for exchanging and safeguarding sensitive information, including what is deemed confidential, usage requirements, agreement lengths, and exceptions. Statements make assertions about these contents, and your task is to evaluate whether these assertions are substantiated or refuted by the NDA.

3->Establish semantic entailment relations between NDA terms and statements about confidentiality obligations. Analyze NDA content to determine if statements are supported or contradicted by the agreement.
----------
4->Your objective is to analyze semantic entailment relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements regarding the confidentiality obligations. To achieve this, carefully examine an input statement to determine if its claims about the NDA are substantiated by the descriptions in the agreement, or if they contradict it. Additionally, verify that the input statement aligns with the specified conditions for handling sensitive information, including its definition, parties' obligations, agreement term, and exclusions.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment and logical consistency between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs document the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, assessing the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Expert statements should either corroborate or refute claims about specific CTR sections or make comparative analyses of two CTRs. For entailment and consistency validation, ensure that the statement's claim is substantiated by the CTR data and does not contradict any information provided in the report.

1->Analyze the coherence and factual alignment between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert opinions within the clinical field. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, aimed at evaluating new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Expert commentary should either support or challenge assertions related to particular segments of CTRs or provide a comparative evaluation of two distinct CTRs. When verifying entailment and consistency, confirm that the expert's assertion is backed by the data in the CTR and does not conflict with the report's content.
----------
2->Evaluate the consistency and accuracy of statements made by medical experts in relation to specific sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Clinical Trial Reports document the methodology and outcomes of clinical research, establishing the safety and efficacy of new treatments. Experts' statements should either corroborate or refute claims about particular parts of CTRs or draw parallels between two CTRs. To ensure consistency and accuracy, verify that the expert's statement is substantiated by the CTR data and does not contradict the report's findings.

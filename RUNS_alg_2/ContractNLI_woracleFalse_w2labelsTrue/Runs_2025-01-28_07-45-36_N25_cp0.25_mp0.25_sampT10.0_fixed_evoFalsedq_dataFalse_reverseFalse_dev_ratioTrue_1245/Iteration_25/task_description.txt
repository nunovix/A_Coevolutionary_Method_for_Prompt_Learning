0->To assess the semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements, evaluate whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's detailed descriptions, including:

1. Definition of confidential information
2. Obligations of the parties
3. Duration of protection
4. Exclusions
5. Other pertinent terms

Determine whether each statement aligns with the NDA content, considering the scope, usage obligations, and other relevant aspects of the agreement. The objective is to identify statements that are either supported or contradicted by the NDA, thereby assessing the semantic entailment between the statements and the agreement.

2->Assess the semantic connection between clauses within Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) by evaluating the alignment of statements with the agreement's scope, usage requirements, and key provisions. Evaluate each statement's support or contradiction with the NDA, considering definition of sensitive information, commitments, timeframe, exemptions, obligations, duration, and other pertinent terms. Identify statements that align or diverge from the NDA content to determine semantic entailment.

0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Evaluate the validity of medical claims based on the content found within individual parts of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). These reports provide insights into the efficacy and safety of experimental therapies. A typical CTR is divided into four key segments: (1) Participant Eligibility Criteria defining who can join the study, (2) Treatment Protocol outlining the treatment type, dosage, frequency, and length, (3) Study Findings summarizing the participant demographics, measured outcomes, units of measurement, and final interpretations, and (4) Side Effects noting any unforeseen adverse reactions. Assess whether the assertions pertain to a single CTR's data or draw comparisons between different CTRs.
----------
2->Assess the semantic entailment between statements from clinical domain experts and specific sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Ensure that expert claims are substantiated by the corresponding CTR information and do not contradict the provided descriptions. Clinical Trial Reports are divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Expert statements may pertain to a single CTR or involve a comparative analysis of two CTRs. Validate entailment by confirming that expert claims are consistent with the CTR content.
----------
3->Evaluate the consistency of expert claims with the information provided in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), which are organized into four distinct sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Experts may reference a single CTR or engage in a comparative analysis of two CTRs. Your objective is to ensure that the claims made by these experts are in harmony with the content of the respective CTRs. This entails verifying that the experts

0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Analyze the semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. CTRs contain four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment specifics, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant data and outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS documenting adverse occurrences. Assess whether expert statements are supported by the CTR data, ensuring no contradictions are present.
----------
2->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to validate expert clinical statements, ensuring consistency across the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections. Verify that expert claims align with the reported data, avoiding contradictions.
----------
3->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to determine the support for expert clinical statements, ensuring consistency across ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION details, RESULTS summaries, and ADVERSE EVENTS documentation. Verify that expert claims do not contradict CTR data.
----------
4->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to validate expert clinical statements, ensuring consistency and non-contradiction across ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION details, RESULTS summaries, and ADVERSE EVENTS documentation.

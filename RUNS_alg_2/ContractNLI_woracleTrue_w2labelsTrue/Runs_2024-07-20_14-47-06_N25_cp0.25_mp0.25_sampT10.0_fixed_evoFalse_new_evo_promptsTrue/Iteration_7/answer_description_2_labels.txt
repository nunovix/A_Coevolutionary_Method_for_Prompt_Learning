The response should be a straightforward 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the NDA information alone is enough to conclude the statement's validity or if additional information is required. This version eliminates any unnecessary context and focuses solely on the task of assessing the NDA's relevance to the statement's truthfulness.

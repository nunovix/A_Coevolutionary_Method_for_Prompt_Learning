0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between expert clinical statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Confirm that these statements are consistent and non-contradictory with respect to the CTRs' Eligibility Criteria, Interventions, Results, and Adverse Events sections. Additionally, verify the consistency of expert statements across multiple CTRs to facilitate both individual and comparative analights.
----------
2->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment evaluation between authoritative clinical claims and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Verify that these expert declarations are both corroborated and non-conflicting with the data in CTRs. Ensure alignment of these declarations with the CTRs' Eligibility Criteria, Interventions, Results, and Adverse Events sections. Uphold consistency in individual and comparative analysis across diverse Clinical Trial Reports.

3->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert clinical statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), verifying that these statements are congruent and non-contradictory with respect to the CTRs' Eligibility Criteria, Interventions, Results, and Adverse Events sections. Confirm the consistency of expert statements across multiple CTRs to facilitate both individual and comparative analyses.
----------
4->

Execute a detailed semantic entailment analysis between expert clinical statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), ensuring congruence and non-contradiction in relation to Eligibility Criteria, Interventions, Results, and Adverse Events. Harmonize expert assertions across various CTRs, maintaining consistency for individual and comparative analights.

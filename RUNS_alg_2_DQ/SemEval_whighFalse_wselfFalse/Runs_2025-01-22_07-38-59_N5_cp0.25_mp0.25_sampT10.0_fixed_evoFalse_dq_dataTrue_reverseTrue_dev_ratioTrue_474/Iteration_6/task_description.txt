0->Consider the problem of assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements put forth by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements should be supported by the CTR information, not contradicting any of the provided descriptions. In brief, CTRs elucidate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, encompassing four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments from different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS summarizing the participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.
----------
1->To determine semantic entailment between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) sections and expert statements, confirm that the statements either support, contradict, or align with the information provided in the CTR sections, specifically focusing on one of the four key areas: ELIGIBILITY, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, or ADVERSE EVENTS. Verify that the statements do not contradict the CTR information and comprehensively cover at least one of these sections.
----------
2->To determine the semantic relationships between different parts of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), compare statements made by clinical experts with the corresponding sections of the reports. Ensure that the statements align with the information provided in the CTRs, without contradicting any descriptions. The CTRs cover four main areas: eligibility criteria, intervention details, results summaries, and adverse event listings. Statements can be made about specific CTRs or comparisons between two CTRs, focusing on the information within these sections.

3->To assess semantic entailment between CTR sections and expert statements, verify that statements align with CTR information, do not contradict it, and cover one of the four CTR sections: ELIGIBILITY, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, or ADVERSE EVENTS.

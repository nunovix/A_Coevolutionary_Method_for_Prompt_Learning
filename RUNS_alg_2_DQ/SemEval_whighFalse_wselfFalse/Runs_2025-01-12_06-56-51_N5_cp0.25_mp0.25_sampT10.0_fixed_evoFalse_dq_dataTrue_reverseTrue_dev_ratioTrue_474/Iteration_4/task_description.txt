0->Consider the problem of assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements put forth by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements should be supported by the CTR information, not contradicting any of the provided descriptions. In brief, CTRs elucidate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, encompassing four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments from different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS summarizing the participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.

1->Assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts involves verifying that these statements align with the information provided in the CTRs. This includes ensuring that the statements do not contradict any of the descriptions in the four main sections of the CTRs: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. In essence, CTRs serve as a foundation for making claims about the data within these sections, either for individual CTRs or when comparing multiple CTRs.

----------
In this task, you are presented with a question that requires common sense reasoning to answer correctly. Each question is followed by five possible answers, labeled A through E. Your goal is to choose the most appropriate answer based on general knowledge, everyday experiences, and logical reasoning. The questions are designed to evaluate your ability to understand and apply common sense knowledge to situations that are not explicitly detailed in the text. You must infer, deduce, or extrapolate the information necessary to select the correct option, relying on a broad understanding of how the world works, including societal norms, physical principles, and human behavior. This task tests your capability to navigate ambiguous or incomplete information and to apply common sense logic in a variety of scenarios.
----------

Analyze complex scenarios that demand human intuition and common sense. Utilize your comprehensive understanding of general knowledge, accumulated life experiences, and innate logic to determine the best answer from five alternatives. Demonstrate effective problem-solving skills using a human-centric perspective.

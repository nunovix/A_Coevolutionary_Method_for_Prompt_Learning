0->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.
----------
1->You are tasked with identifying support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about these contents, and your task is to assess if these claims are supported or contradicted in the NDA.
----------
2->Consider the challenge of assessing semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements. NDAs outline procedures and obligations for protecting confidential information, including its scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions. Evaluate whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions.
----------
3->Your objective is to scrutinize semantic entailment relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements regarding the confidentiality obligations. NDAs specify conditions for handling sensitive information, including its definition, parties' obligations, agreement term, and exclusions. Carefully examine an input statement to determine if its claims about the NDA are substantiated by the descriptions in the agreement, or if they contradict it.

4->Evaluate the support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. Assess whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis linking segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with expert claims on therapeutic efficacy and safety. Rigorously assess each CTR's methodology, results, and narratives to confirm that expert assertions are supported, consistent with, and in agreement with the clinical trial data. This analysis should cover individual CTR sections and enable comparative evaluations across different CTRs, leading to a thorough and expert-level examination.
----------
2->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative statements from clinical experts, concentrating on the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Examine the methodologies, findings, and descriptions in CTRs to confirm consistency, agreement, and absence of contradiction with expert claims. This necessitates a detailed review and comparative analysis across various CTRs.
----------
3->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between chosen excerpts from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and explicit claims made by clinical professionals, with a focus on methodologies, outcomes, treatment efficacy, and safety profiles. Rigorously examine CTRs for detailed insights into clinical trial methodologies and results, while expert statements concentrate on particular CTR sections for case studies or comparative analyses. Confirm entailment by verifying that the expert claim aligns with the clinical trial data, is supported by the CTR, and remains faithful to the original descriptions.

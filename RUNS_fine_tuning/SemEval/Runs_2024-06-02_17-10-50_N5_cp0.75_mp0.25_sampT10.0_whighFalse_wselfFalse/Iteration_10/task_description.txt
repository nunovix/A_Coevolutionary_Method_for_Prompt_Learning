0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Execute a detailed semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions, focusing on patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, and duration), comprehensive results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (noting observed signs and symptoms). Ensure methodological precision, evidence-based consistency, and strict adherence to provided descriptions for an exhaustive comparative assessment, with emphasis on methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

2->

Conduct an in-depth semantic entailment or support analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. Your focus should be on patient eligibility criteria, detailed intervention specifics including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, comprehensive results encompassing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, as well as documented adverse events with observed signs and symptoms. Maintain strict consistency with CTR content, evidence-based support, and adherence to provided descriptions for a thorough comparative evaluation. Pay particular attention to methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

Execute an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and domain-specific clinical assertions, focusing on patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, duration), detailed results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, conclusions), and documented adverse events (observed signs and symptoms). Ensure methodological precision, evidence-based consistency, and strict adherence to provided descriptions for a comprehensive comparative assessment. Emphasize methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

Execute a comprehensive semantic entailment or support analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions, focusing on patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, duration), detailed results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, conclusions), and adverse events (observed signs and symptoms). Ensure strict correspondence with CTR content, evidence-based support, and provided descriptions for an exhaustive comparative evaluation. Emphasize methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

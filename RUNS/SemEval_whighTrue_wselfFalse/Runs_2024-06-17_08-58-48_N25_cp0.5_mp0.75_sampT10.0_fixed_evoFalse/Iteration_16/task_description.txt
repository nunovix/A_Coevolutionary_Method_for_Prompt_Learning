0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.

1->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
2->The objective is to examine semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements articulated by clinical domain experts. CTRs elaborate on the procedures and findings of clinical trials, scrutinizing the effectiveness and safety of novel treatments. Each trial involves cohorts or arms exposed to distinct treatments or exhibiting diverse baseline characteristics. Comprehensive CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA delineating conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION particulars specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary encompassing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS cataloging signs and symptoms observed. Statements posit claims regarding the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or in comparative analysis of two. To establish entailment, the statement's assertion should harmonize with clinical trial data, find substantiation in the CTR, and avoid contradiction with the provided descriptions.

Perform an in-depth examination of Clinical Trial Documents and Reports by dissecting them into four primary elements: (1) elucidate Participant Eligibility Criteria, (2) detail Treatment Plans including modality, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) collate Findings with participant demographics, outcome metrics, measurements, and conclusions, and (4) meticulously record Adverse Reactions, noting all observed side effects. Cross-reference CTD and CTR data with authentic clinical trials for precision. Utilize CTD information to refine analysis, vigilantly identify inconsistencies, and critically appraise semantic connections between CTR sections and conventional clinical trial protocols, with a focus on evaluating treatment efficacy and safety.

"You're a very capable AI agent, and your task is to skillfully identify and map support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs provide valuable insights into the methodology and findings of clinical trials, evaluating the effectiveness and safety of innovative treatments. With your expertise, you'll navigate through the 4 sections of a CTR: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines the conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms. You'll also compare and contrast statements related to these sections, either for a single CTR or between two. You've got this!"

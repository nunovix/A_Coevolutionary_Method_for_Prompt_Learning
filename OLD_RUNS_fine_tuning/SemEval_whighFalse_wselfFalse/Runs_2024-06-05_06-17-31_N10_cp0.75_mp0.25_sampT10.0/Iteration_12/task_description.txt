0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic analysis to link segments within Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with authoritative clinical statements, verifying therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Align expert claims with CTRs' eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse event records, ensuring coherence and non-contradiction across individual or comparative CTR analyses. Confirm consistency and absence of contradictions with expert clinical assertions regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse events.

2->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic analysis to establish connections between segments in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines, confirming the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Validate the congruence of expert claims with the eligibility criteria, intervention details, results, and adverse event records in CTRs, ensuring logical consistency and non-contradiction in both singular and comparative examinations of CTRs.
----------
3->

Conduct an in-depth analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on the interplay between the four principal sections: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Identify and scrutinize the clinical statements associated with these sections, which detail patient inclusion conditions, treatment specifics (type, dosage, frequency, and duration), summarized participant data and outcomes, and documented adverse signs and symptoms. Your analysis should be precise and clear, referencing either a single CTR or multiple CTRs, to facilitate expert-level interpretation.
----------
4->

Perform an exhaustive semantic analysis to correlate segments within Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, verifying therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Confirm alignment with expert testimonies on eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse events across individual or multiple CTRs, ensuring coherence and non-contradiction with expert clinical assertions.

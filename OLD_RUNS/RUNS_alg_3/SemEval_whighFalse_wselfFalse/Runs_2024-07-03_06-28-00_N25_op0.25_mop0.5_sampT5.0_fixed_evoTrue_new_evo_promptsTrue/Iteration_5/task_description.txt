0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions. The CTRs are divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments from different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms.

3->Evaluate the semantic entailment and logical coherence between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert declarations within the clinical field. CTRs document the protocols and outcomes of clinical trials, assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Expert declarations articulate assertions about specific CTR sections or compare two CTRs. Validate entailment by ensuring the expert's claim is substantiated by the CTR data and does not conflict with the trial's documented findings. The CTRs are divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments from different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms.

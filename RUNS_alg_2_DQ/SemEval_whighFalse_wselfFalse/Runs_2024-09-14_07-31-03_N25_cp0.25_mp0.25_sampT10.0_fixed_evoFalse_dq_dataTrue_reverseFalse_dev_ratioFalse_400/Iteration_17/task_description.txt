0->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the validity of clinical statements. CTRs contain four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Determine if statements accurately reflect the content of these sections or compare findings between two CTRs.

1->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify the accuracy of clinical statements. CTRs are structured into four main sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Treatment Protocol, (3) Outcomes, and (4) Adverse Events. Assess the truthfulness of clinical claims by carefully comparing them with the relevant parts of the CTRs, ensuring a thorough and scientifically rigorous evaluation.
----------
2->Review Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to assess the accuracy of clinical statements. CTRs are structured into four main parts: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Verify that statements are consistent with the information presented in these sections or contrast findings from different CTRs.
----------
3->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to ascertain the accuracy of clinical assertions. CTRs are structured into four principal segments: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention Details, (3) Outcome Data, and (4) Adverse Event Reporting. Assess whether the clinical assertions are congruent with the information presented in these segments or if there are discrepancies when contrasting two CTRs.
----------
4->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to validate clinical statements. CTRs are divided into four main sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Confirm if the clinical statements align with the information in these sections or identify inconsistencies when comparing two CTRs.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.

2->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

Confirm consistency with CTR sections, preventing contradictions. Integrate participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions into the analysis. Validate entailment by comparing expert statements with CTR sections, ensuring alignment with trial data and no contradictions.

Ensure consistency with CTR sections, avoiding contradictions. Integrate participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions into the analysis. Validate entailment by comparing expert statements with CTR sections, ensuring alignment with trial data and no contradictions. Determine the support of clinical statements from individual sections of CTRs, which include eligibility criteria, intervention details, results, and adverse events, and compare adverseverse events. Statements may pertain to a single CTR or compare two.


RESULTING INSTRUCTION:

Analyze the semantic entailment between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) sections and domain experts' evaluations of treatment efficacy, safety, eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events, and conclusions. Ensure consistency with CTR sections, avoiding contradictions. Integrate participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions into the analysis. Validate entailment by comparing expert statements with CTR sections, ensuring alignment with trial data and no contradictions. Determine the support of clinical statements from individual sections of CTRs, including eligibility criteria, intervention details, results, and adverse events, and compare statements for a single CTR or between two CTRs.

2-> Analyze individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to determine the support for clinical statements. A CTR typically consists of four main sections: 

1. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Outlines patient participation conditions. 

2. INTERVENTION: Describes treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration. 

3. RESULTS: Summarizes key findings, including participant info, outcome measures, units, and conclusions. 

4. ADVERSE EVENTS: Lists unexpected signs and symptoms. 

Evaluate statements making claims about the information in these sections, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two CTRs. Carefully examine each section to determine the support for these statements.

2->Generate a clinical note imitating the structure of the provided sample, integrating key elements from two different instructional scenarios. Ensure the final instruction serves as a comprehensive guide for experts in clinical documentation, capturing the essence of both original instructions and maintaining precision in medical terminology.


Resulting Combined Instruction: "Develop a clinical note replicating the sample's layout, incorporating elements from the initial instructions. Use similar section headings if possible, but prioritize a clear and accurate representation of the task. This instruction should serve as an expert-level guideline for clinical note creation, synthesizing the core directives from both original instructions."

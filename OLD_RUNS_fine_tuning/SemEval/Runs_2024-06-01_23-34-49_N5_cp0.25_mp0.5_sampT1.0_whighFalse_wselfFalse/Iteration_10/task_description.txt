Execute a detailed semantic entailment analysis to validate expert claims by meticulously cross-referencing data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), ensuring congruence with initial descriptions. This necessitates an exhaustive examination of CTRs that encapsulate clinical trial methodologies and results, with a particular emphasis on assessing the efficacy and safety of innovative medical treatments. Ascertain that experts' statements are corroborated by CTRs, remain faithful to the original descriptions, and are firmly rooted in empirical evidence derived from the CTRs. Additionally, when comparing specialists' claims across multiple CTRs, verify that these claims are consistent, substantiated, and non-contradictory to the provided descriptions.

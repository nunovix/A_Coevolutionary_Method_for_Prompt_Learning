0->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.
----------
1->You are tasked with identifying support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about these contents, and your task is to assess if these claims are supported or contradicted in the NDA.
----------
2->Evaluate semantic entailment between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements related to the confidentiality obligations they impose. NDAs govern the sharing and protection of sensitive data, outlining the scope of confidential information, obligations, agreement lifespan, and exclusions. Assess whether the claims made in a statement align with, or contradict, the information covered in a non-disclosure agreement.
----------
3->Your objective is to scrutinize semantic entailment relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements regarding the confidentiality obligations. NDAs specify conditions for handling sensitive information, including its definition, parties' obligations, agreement term, and exclusions. Carefully examine an input statement to determine if its claims about the NDA are substantiated by the descriptions in the agreement, or if they contradict it.
----------
4->Your task is to meticulously analyze the semantic entailment between various sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and corresponding statements about confidentiality obligations. Examine an input statement to ascertain whether it accurately reflects the conditions for handling sensitive information as outlined in the NDA, which includes the definition of confidential information, the obligations of the parties involved, the duration of the agreement, and any specific exclusions. Ensure that the statement aligns with the NDA's provisions or identify any discrepancies.
----------
5->Your objective is to perform an in-depth analysis of the semantic entailment connections between different parts of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and the confidentiality clauses they contain. NDAs specify how sensitive information should be handled, including its exact definition, the duties of the parties involved, the time frame of the agreement, and any particular exclusions. Carefully scrutinize an input statement to determine if its claims about the NDA are supported by the agreement's content or if they contradict it.
----------
6->Conduct an exhaustive analysis of the semantic entailment between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements about confidentiality obligations, focusing on the precise definition of sensitive information, parties' responsibilities, agreement duration, and specific exclusions. Assess whether a given claim aligns with or contradicts the NDA's content.
----------
7->Your task is to conduct a thorough examination of the semantic entailment relationships between various sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning the confidentiality obligations they establish. NDAs delineate the parameters for managing sensitive information, encompassing its precise definition, the responsibilities of the involved parties, the duration of the agreement, and any specific exclusions. It is crucial to meticulously analyze an input statement to ascertain whether its assertions about the NDA are corroborated by the content within the agreement or if they are in conflict with it.

Total elapsed time: 0:01:53.000892
No. of iterations: 1
Average time per iteration: 0:01:53.000892

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 2
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 0
Max no. of iterations allowed: 3
Patience: 1
Decoder temperature in mutation and combiantions: 1.0
Top-p in sampling for mutation and combiantions: 0.8

Evaluation done on: dev set
With 10 examples

Name of the model used: mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
Mutation evaluation done with N=None, with probability=None

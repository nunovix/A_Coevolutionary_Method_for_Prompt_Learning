Total elapsed time: 7:35:25.505332
No. of iterations: 10
Average time per iteration: 0:45:32.550533

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 5
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 1
Max no. of iterations allowed: 200
Patience: 10
Evaluation done on: dev set
With 474 examples

Label distribution: Counter({'Entailment': 237, 'Contradiction': 237})

Name of the model used: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
Retrieving examples-->False 
Alg 2 - Random sample 2 individuals weighted on scores, apply crossover and mutation to the offspring, top 1 performers are always kept as elite population
With crossover probability 0.5 and mutation probability 0.5

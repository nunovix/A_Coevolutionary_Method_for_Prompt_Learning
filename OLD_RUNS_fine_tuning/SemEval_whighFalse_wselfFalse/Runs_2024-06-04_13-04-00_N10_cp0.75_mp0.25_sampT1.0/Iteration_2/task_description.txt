0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Analyze the semantic relationships between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions on treatment efficacy and safety. Evaluate CTRs involving distinct patient groups and treatments, divided into: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA for patient selection, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment specifics including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant count, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements must correlate with these segments, substantiated by CTR data, and remain consistent with the descriptions.

2->Your task is to identify semantic entailment links between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical experts. CTRs encapsulate clinical trial methodologies and outcomes, assessing the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. Each CTR is divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which specifies patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, presenting participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, noting observed signs and symptoms. Statements should accurately reflect information from a single CTR or comparative analyses between CTRs, ensuring consistency with expert descriptions and avoiding contradictions.

3->

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on semantic relationships between segments and expert clinical assertions about treatment efficacy and safety. Evaluate CTRs with 1-2 distinct patient groups and treatments. Break down CTRs into: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA for patient selection, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment specifics including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant count, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS documenting observed patient signs and symptoms. Ensure statements comparing two CTRs align with these segments, are substantiated by CTR data, and are consistent with original descriptions.

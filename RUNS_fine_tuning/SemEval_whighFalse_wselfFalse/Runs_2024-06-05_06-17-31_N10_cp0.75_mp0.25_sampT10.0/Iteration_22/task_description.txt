0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Execute a detailed semantic evaluation to align and authenticate data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines, verifying the efficacy and safety of medical interventions. Harmonize expert consensus on eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, expected results, and adverse event documentation through singular and comparative analyses of CTRs. Ensure logical coherence, prevent contradictions, and maintain strict compliance with established clinical expertise regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, anticipated outcomes, and adverse event reporting.

2->Your task is to analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by identifying and elucidating the supportive relationships between individual sections and clinical statements. CTRs encompass four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining patient participation conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Statements drawn from these sections either support a single CTR or facilitate comparative analysis between trials.

3->

Perform an exhaustive semantic analysis to correlate data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines, ensuring the verification of medical interventions' efficacy and safety. Authenticate and integrate expert consensus on eligibility criteria, intervention details, anticipated outcomes, and adverse event documentation through singular and comparative analyses of CTRs. Maintain logical consistency, avoid contradictions, and ensure strict adherence to established clinical expertise regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, expected results, and adverse event reporting.
----------
4->Your task is to analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by identifying and elucidating the supportive connections between individual sections and clinical statements. CTRs encapsulate trial methodologies and findings, evaluating new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Comprising four distinct sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines patient participation conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Clinical statements should be scrutinized for claims related to these sections in isolation or in comparative contexts.

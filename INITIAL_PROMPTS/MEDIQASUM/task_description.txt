Consider the task of writing a clinical note summarizing a conversation between a doctor and patient. The note should be structured into distict parts, for instance segmenting contents that correspond to statements about relevant client behaviors or status (SUBJECTIVE), observable, quantifiable, and measurable data (OBJECTIVE), an analysis of the information given by the patient (ASSESSMENT), and an outline of the next course of action (PLANNING). Be as accurate as possible in the summarization, attending to clinical concepts that are identified as present or absent in the transcription of the conversation.

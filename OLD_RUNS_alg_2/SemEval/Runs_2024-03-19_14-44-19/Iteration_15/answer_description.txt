Your response should be a YES if the statement's validity can be assessed based on the information presented in the clinical trial reports, and a NO if it cannot.
----------


To assess the validity of a statement in relation to Clinical Trial Report (CTR) information:
1. Interpret the medical terminology used in both the statement and the CTR
2. Evaluate the context of the statement in the context of the CTR
3. Identify and clarify any ambiguities or inconsistencies between the statement and the CTR.

The resulting instruction is:

Determine if the statement aligns with the Clinical Trial Report (CTR) information by interpreting the medical terminology and evaluating the context, while clarifying any ambiguities or inconsistencies.
----------


Evaluate the alignment and consistency of the statement with the Clinical Trial Report descriptions:
- YES: The statement is valid and consistent with the CTR descriptions
- NO: The statement contradicts or is inconsistent with the CTR descriptions. (Note: This instruction also preserves the original meaning while being more concise and clear for experts in the field to follow, but adds a definition of "validity" and "consistency" for further clarification if necessary.)

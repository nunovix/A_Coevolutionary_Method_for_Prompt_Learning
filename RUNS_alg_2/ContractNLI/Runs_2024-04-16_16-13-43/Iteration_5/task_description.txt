Address any inconsistencies or discrepancies to accurately reflect the NDA's confidentiality provisions.
----------
13->

Assess the alignment of the NDA text and confidentiality declarations in terms of definitions of confidential information, parties' obligations, durations, permitted uses, and exclusions.
Resolve any inconsistencies or contradictions found between specific NDA sections and statements concerning confidentiality obligations.
----------
14->

Evaluate the consistency of statements with NDA provisions concerning confidential information:

1. Match definitions of confidential materials in statements and NDAs.
2. Equalize confidentiality obligations for all parties in statements and NDAs.
3. Synchronize agreement periods in statements with NDA timeframes.
4. Coordinate confidentiality exceptions in statements and NDAs.
5. Adhere to NDA definitions, duties, durations, limitations, and related provisions in statements.

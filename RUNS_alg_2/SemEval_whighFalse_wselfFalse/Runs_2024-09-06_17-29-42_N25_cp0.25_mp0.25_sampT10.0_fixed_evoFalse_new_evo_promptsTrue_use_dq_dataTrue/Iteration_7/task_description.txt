0->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for semantic entailment, ensuring expert statements align with the CTRs' sections on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS, maintaining consistency when comparing statements from different CTRs.

1->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for semantic entailment, ensuring that expert statements are consistent with the CTRs' sections on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. When comparing statements from different CTRs, verify that they do not contradict the provided descriptions. Clinical Trial Reports detail the procedures and findings of clinical trials, which are organized into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA that outline the conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION that describe the treatments administered to different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS that summarize participant statistics and the outcomes of the trial, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS that list any observed signs and symptoms experienced by the participants. Ensure that expert claims about the information within these sections are supported by the CTRs and are not in conflict with each other.

2->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify that expert analyses are consistent with the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections. Ensure expert interpretations are supported by the CTRs and are coherent across different analyses.
----------
3->Analyze Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) for logical coherence, confirming that expert commentary aligns with the CTDs' segments on PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS, TREATMENT PROCEDURES, STUDY OUTCOMES, and PARTICIPANT SIDE EFFECTS. Cross-examine statements from various CTDs to ensure they are in harmony with the content described. Clinical Trial Documents encapsulate the methodology and discoveries of clinical trials, categorized into four principal divisions: (1) PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS that specify the qualifications for patient enrollment, (2) TREATMENT PROCEDURES that delineate the interventions given to various participant groups, (3) STUDY OUTCOMES that encapsulate participant data and the trial's results, and (4) PARTICIPANT SIDE EFFECTS that record any adverse symptoms reported by the participants. Validate that expert interpretations of these sections are corroborated by the CTDs and do not contradict each other.

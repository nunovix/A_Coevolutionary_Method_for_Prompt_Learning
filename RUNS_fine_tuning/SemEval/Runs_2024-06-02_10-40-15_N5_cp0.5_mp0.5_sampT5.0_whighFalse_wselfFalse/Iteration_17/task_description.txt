0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

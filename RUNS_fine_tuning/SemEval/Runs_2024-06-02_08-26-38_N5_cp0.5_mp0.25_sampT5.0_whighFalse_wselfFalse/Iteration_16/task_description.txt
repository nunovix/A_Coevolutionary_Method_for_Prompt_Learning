0->Analyze semantic entailment relationships between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, focusing on methodology, findings, eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Each CTR, involving 1-2 patient cohorts, assesses new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Statements, made by clinical experts, must align with CTR information, be substantiated by the reports, and remain consistent with provided descriptions to establish entailment.

1->

Perform an in-depth examination of semantic entailment between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert testimonies, focusing on methodology, findings, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcomes, and adverse effects. Analyze each CTR, which contains 1-2 patient cohorts, to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Ensure that clinical experts' statements align with CTR data, are supported by the reports, and maintain consistency with the original descriptions to establish entailment.
----------
2->

Analyze the semantic entailment connections between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative expert statements, focusing on methodology, results, inclusion/exclusion parameters, therapeutic interventions, outcomes, and adverse reactions. Each CTR, comprising one to two patient cohorts, scrutinizes the effectiveness and safety of innovative treatments. Verify that expert declarations are corroborated by CTR data, are consistent with the provided descriptions, and validate entailment.

3->

Perform an in-depth examination of semantic entailment between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert testimonies, focusing on methodology, findings, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcomes, and adverse effects. Analyze each CTR, which includes 1-2 patient groups, assessing the effectiveness and safety of innovative therapies. Ensure that clinical experts' statements align with CTR data, are supported by the reports, and maintain consistency with the original descriptions to validate entailment.
----------
4->Conduct a detailed analysis of semantic entailment between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) sections and expert statements, emphasizing methodology, findings, eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Each CTR, encompassing 1-2 patient cohorts, evaluates the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. Clinical experts' statements must be in strict alignment with CTR details, substantiated by the reports, and consistent with initial descriptions to confirm entailment.

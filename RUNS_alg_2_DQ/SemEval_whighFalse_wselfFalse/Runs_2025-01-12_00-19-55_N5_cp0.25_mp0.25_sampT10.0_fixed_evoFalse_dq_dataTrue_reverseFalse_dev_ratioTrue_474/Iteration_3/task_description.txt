0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts, focusing on the alignment of claim statements with the methodology and outcomes described in CTRs. This entails verifying that the statement's claim is supported by the CTR information and does not contradict any provided descriptions.
----------
1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts, focusing on the alignment of claim statements with the methodology, outcomes, and supporting evidence described in CTRs. Verify that the statement's claim is supported by the CTR information and does not contradict any provided descriptions, methodology, or outcomes.
----------
2-> Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Statements assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. To validate entailment, ensure the statement's claim aligns with CTR information and does not contradict any provided descriptions.

3-> Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts, focusing on the alignment of claim statements with the methodology and outcomes described in CTRs. This entails verifying that the statement's claim is supported by the CTR information and does not contradict any provided descriptions. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

4->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
5->Determine the support for clinical statements by analyzing individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs include four main sections: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Clinical statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two.

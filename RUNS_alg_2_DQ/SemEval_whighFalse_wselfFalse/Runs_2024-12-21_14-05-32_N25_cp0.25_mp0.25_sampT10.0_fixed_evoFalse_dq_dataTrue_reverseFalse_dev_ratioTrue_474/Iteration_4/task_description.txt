0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. Assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of CTRs and statements made by clinical domain experts involves verifying that these statements align with the provided CTR information, without contradicting any descriptions. This process requires verifying that statements align with the information within the four key sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two CTRs.

2->"Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Trials involve patient groups, called cohorts or arms, which may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. A complete CTR contains 4 sections: (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. Statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.

3->Determine the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of CTRs and statements made by clinical domain experts. This involves verifying that statements align with the information within the four key sections: 

1. Eligibility Criteria: listing conditions for patient participation.
2. Intervention: describing type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments.
3. Results: summarizing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions.
4. Adverse Events: listing unexpected signs and symptoms.

Verify that statements align with the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two CTRs, without contradicting any descriptions.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

2->

Assess the semantic entailment between discrete segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical specialists. CTRs detail the procedures and results of clinical trials, evaluating the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. The assertions, conversely, pertain to specific sections of CTRs, either for a single report or for comparative analysis between two. For entailment verification, ensure that the assertion corresponds with the clinical trial data, is substantiated by the CTR, and does not conflict with the given descriptions.

3->Your objective is to identify semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. Establish entailment when a statement's claim is corroborated by a CTR, without contradicting expert descriptions. CTRs contain methodologies and findings of clinical trials, evaluating the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. The CTRs are divided into four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, specifying treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements claim information within these sections for a single CTR or in comparative analyses between two CTRs.

4->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative statements on treatment efficacy and safety within clinical trials. Dissect CTRs into four key components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, describing patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION DETAILS, detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS SUMMARY, providing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Ensure expert statements align with data in these sections for individual or comparative CTR analysis. Confirm entailment by verifying the statement's claim is consistent with clinical trial data, substantiated by the CTR, and non-contradictory to the descriptions.

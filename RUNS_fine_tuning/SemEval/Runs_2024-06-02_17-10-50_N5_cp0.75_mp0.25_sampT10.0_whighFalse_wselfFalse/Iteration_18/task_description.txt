0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Perform a detailed semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements. Thoroughly scrutinize patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, and duration), comprehensive results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (observed signs and symptoms). Ensure complete compliance with CTR content, evidence-based support, and precise descriptions. The analysis should emphasize methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions. Validate entailment by confirming that the clinical statements' claims are consistent with, supported by, and do not contradict the clinical trial information.

2->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements. This analysis should meticulously compare patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), comprehensive results (encompassing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (detailing observed signs and symptoms). Uphold strict compliance with CTR content, evidence-based support, and precise descriptions for a thorough comparative analysis. Clarify methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions. Validate entailment by ensuring the clinical statements' claims are congruent with, substantiated by, and non-contradictory to the clinical trial data.

3->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis contrasting segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with authoritative clinical statements, focusing on patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), comprehensive results (detailing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (noting observed signs and symptoms). Ensure strict compliance with CTR content, evidence-based support, and precise descriptions. Emphasize methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

4->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis contrasting segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements. Pay particular attention to patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), comprehensive results (detailing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (noting observed signs and symptoms). Maintain strict compliance with the content of CTRs, ensure evidence-based support, and provide precise descriptions for a detailed comparative analysis. Your focus should be on methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

0->Summarize the physician-patient dialogue into a structured clinical note. Start with the patient's chief complaint and pertinent medical history. Then, detail objective findings and measurements. Follow with the physician's evaluation and diagnosis. Conclude with the prescribed medication regimen and the schedule for patient follow-up.
----------
1->Compose a healthcare note that encapsulates all the relevant information in a verbal exchange between a doctor and a patient. Adhere to standard recommendations for structuring clinical notes, considering parts such as the History of the Present Illness (HPI), a Review of Systems (ROS), conclusions from a Physical Examination (PE), lab and imaging results, and other relevant tests, and finally the doctor's Assessment and treatment Plan (A/P). As a way to aid you in the wrtiting of the note, you'll also be provided with an example note. Use it as a way to know the proper structure you should use.
----------
2->Craft a comprehensive clinical note that captures the essence of a dialogue between a healthcare provider and a patient. Ensure the note adheres to the conventional format of clinical documentation, which includes the patient's History of Present Illness (HPI), a thorough Review of Systems (ROS), findings from the Physical Examination (PE), and interpretations of laboratory and imaging studies. Conclude with the healthcare provider's Assessment and proposed Treatment Plan (A/P). Utilize the provided exemplar note to guide the structure of your documentation.

3->"Craft a comprehensive clinical note that captures the essence of a dialogue between a healthcare provider and a patient. Ensure the note adheres to the conventional format used in medical documentation, which includes sections such as the History of the Present Illness (HPI), Review of Systems (ROS), findings from the Physical Examination (PE), laboratory and imaging test outcomes, and other pertinent assessments. Utilize the provided exemplar note to guide the structuring of your document."

RESULT:

The rephrased instruction now clearly outlines the task of creating a detailed clinical note based on a patient-doctor interaction. It specifies the necessary components of the note, such as HPI, ROS, PE findings, lab/imaging results, and the assessment/treatment plan, and instructs the use of an example note for structuring guidance.
----------
4->Craft a concise yet comprehensive clinical note encapsulating the dialogue between a healthcare provider and a patient. Ensure the note adheres to the conventional clinical documentation structure, which includes a succinct History of Present Illness (HPI), an abridged Review of Systems (ROS), pertinent findings from the Physical Examination (PE), and a synthesized interpretation of laboratory and imaging results. Conclude with the healthcare provider's Assessment and tailored Treatment Plan (A/P). The exemplar note should serve as a model for the note's organization.
----------
5->Craft a detailed medical record that encapsulates the dialogue between a doctor and their patient. Ensure the record follows the conventional medical record-keeping format, which consists of the patient's current symptoms narrative (HPI), an extensive check of bodily systems (ROS), observations made during the physical check-up (PE), analyses of test results from bloodwork or scans, and the healthcare professional's diagnosis and proposed care strategy (A/P). Use the given example note as a guide to create a structured and all-encompassing record.

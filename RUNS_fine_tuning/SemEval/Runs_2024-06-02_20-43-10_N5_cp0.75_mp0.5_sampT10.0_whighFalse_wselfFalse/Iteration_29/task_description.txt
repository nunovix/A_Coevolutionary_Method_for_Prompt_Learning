0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->Perform an in-depth semantic entailment and comparative analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical case studies, examining data interpretation, research methodologies, outcomes, therapeutic efficacy, and safety evaluations. Adhere strictly to clinical protocols, employ precise medical terminology, and maintain semantic alignment with expert clinical narratives. Validate CTR data through cross-referencing with related CTRs, corroborate findings with pertinent CTRs, and execute detailed analyses or comparisons consistent with established expert clinical insights.

0->Analyze semantic entailment relationships between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, focusing on methodology, findings, eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Each CTR, involving 1-2 patient cohorts, assesses new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Statements, made by clinical experts, must align with CTR information, be substantiated by the reports, and remain consistent with provided descriptions to establish entailment.

1->

Analyze the semantic entailment relationships between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, with a focus on methodology, findings, inclusion/exclusion criteria, therapeutic interventions, outcomes, and adverse events. Each CTR, involving 1-2 patient cohorts, assesses the effectiveness and safety of novel treatments. Ensure expert statements are substantiated by CTR data, align with provided descriptions, and validate entailment.
----------
2->

Examine the semantic entailment connections between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative declarations, emphasizing methodology, results, inclusion/exclusion parameters, therapeutic interventions, outcomes, and adverse reactions. Each CTR, encompassing 1-2 patient groups, evaluates the efficacy and safety of innovative therapies. Verify that expert declarations are corroborated by CTR data, are consistent with given descriptions, and confirm entailment.

0->Analyze and validate clinical statements derived from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs provide comprehensive insights into clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutics. The CTRs are divided into four distinct sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining eligibility criteria for patient participation; (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the intervention's type, dosage, frequency, and duration; (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions; and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any unexpected adverse events. Formulate statements based on these sections, either pertaining to a single CTR or contrasting two CTRs.

Consider the problem of combining two different textual instructions, pertaining to the same task. The objective is to rephrase the main information common to the two descriptions, while keeping their meaning and intent. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The combined instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The combined instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instructions.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

Perform a detailed semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements, focusing on patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, and duration), comprehensive results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (observed signs and symptoms). Ensure methodological precision, evidence-based consistency, and strict adherence to provided descriptions for a thorough comparative assessment, emphasizing methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

Perform a detailed semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims, scrutinizing patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention specifics (type, dosage, frequency, duration), comprehensive results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, conclusions), and documented adverse events (observed signs and symptoms). Ensure methodological rigor, evidence-based alignment, and strict compliance with the given descriptions for an exhaustive comparative evaluation, focusing on methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

4->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims, meticulously examining patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), comprehensive results (detailing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (noting observed signs and symptoms). Ensure rigorous compliance with CTR content, evidence-based backing, and precise descriptions for an in-depth comparative assessment. Prioritize methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

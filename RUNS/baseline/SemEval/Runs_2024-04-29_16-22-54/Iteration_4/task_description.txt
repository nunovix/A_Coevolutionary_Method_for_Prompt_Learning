Assess entailment connections between statements made by clinical domain experts and specific sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). The expert's claim should be supported by the CTR and not contradict its content. CTRs provide details on clinical trials, outlining procedures, findings, and the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Comprised of four sections, a complete CTR includes: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA defining patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements can make claims about individual CTRs or be compared across multiple reports.

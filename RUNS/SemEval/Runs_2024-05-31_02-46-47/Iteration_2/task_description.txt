0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Conduct a detailed analysis of the semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert assertions, emphasizing methodology, results, eligibility criteria, interventions, participant outcomes, and adverse events. For each CTR, scrutinize 1-2 patient cohorts, documenting distinct treatments and baseline characteristics. Confirm entailment by verifying that statements are clinically pertinent, substantiated by CTRs, and non-contradictory.
----------
2->

Determine semantic entailment relations between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, focusing on methodology, findings, eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Analyze whether expert claims are supported and non-contradictory with respect to CTRs, which detail clinical trials assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety, involving patient cohorts with varying treatments and baseline characteristics.

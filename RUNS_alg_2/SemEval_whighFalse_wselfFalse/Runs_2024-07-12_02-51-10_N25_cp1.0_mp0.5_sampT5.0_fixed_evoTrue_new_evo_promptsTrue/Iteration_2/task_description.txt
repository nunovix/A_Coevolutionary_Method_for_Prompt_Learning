0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->The objective is to examine semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements articulated by clinical domain experts. CTRs elaborate on the procedures and findings of clinical trials, which aim at assessing treatment effectiveness and safety. Each trial involves cohorts of patients exposed to distinct treatments or exhibiting diverse baseline characteristics. Comprehensive CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, delineating conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detaining the treatments, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, cataloging relevant observations. Statements posit claims regarding the clinical information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. Establishing entailment requires assessing if the statements are compatible with the clinical trial data, avoiding any contradictions with the CTRs.
----------
2->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Verify if expert statements about these sections are semantically enta0led by the CTRs, ensuring no contradictions are present.
----------
3->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), which are divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Determine if expert statements about these sections are semantically entailed by the CTRs, ensuring no contradictions are present.
----------
4->Review Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on four key areas: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Confirm that expert commentary on these sections is semantically consistent and free from contradictions.
----------
5->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify the accuracy of statements regarding eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events.
----------
6->Analyze clinical trial reports (CTRs), which are divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Determine if expert statements about these sections are semantically entailed by the CTRs, ensuring no contradictions are present.

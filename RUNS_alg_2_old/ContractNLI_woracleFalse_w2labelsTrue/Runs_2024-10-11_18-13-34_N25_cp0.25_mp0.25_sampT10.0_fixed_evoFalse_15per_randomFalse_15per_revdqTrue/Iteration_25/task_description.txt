4->Conduct a thorough examination of the confidentiality clauses within Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and standalone confidentiality statements. Specifically, scrutinize the criteria used to define confidential information, the authorized purposes for its disclosure, the duration for which secrecy must be upheld, and any exceptions to these rules. Ensure that the application of confidentiality measures is consistent between NDAs and separate confidentiality statements.
----------
5->Perform an in-depth analysis of confidentiality provisions in Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) versus those in external confidentiality statements. Evaluate the specificity with which confidential information is identified, the legally permissible purposes for its use, the timeframe for which confidentiality must be maintained, and any stipulated exceptions. Aim for uniformity in the enforcement of confidentiality standards across both NDAs and external statements.

0->You are tasked with merging two different instructions that aim at the same objective. You should rephrase the core information that is common to both descriptions, taking the best ideas from each and building upon them to enhance clarity (e.g., by replacing words, deleting irrelevant parts, or changing the ordering of the statements). You have the freedom to add further explanations and clarifications where necessary, as long as the final instruction remains clear, comprehensive, easy to follow, and true to the original intent. The goal is to create a combined instruction that not only preserves the essential information from both descriptions, but also improves upon it, making it easier for experts in the field to execute the task accurately and efficiently.
----------
1->Synthesize the essential elements from both provided directions, ensuring a clear, concise, and comprehensive guide for experts to execute the task with confidence and precision. Incorporate the most effective ideas, refine the language for improved clarity, and maintain fidelity to the original objectives. Enhance the instruction with necessary definitions and clarifications to facilitate accurate and efficient task completion.
----------
2->Synthesize the objectives from both original directives, extracting and refining the key elements to form a singular, streamlined directive. Ensure the new instruction maintains fidelity to the original intents while enhancing readability and comprehension for specialists.
----------
3->Synthesize the core objectives from the provided directives, distilling the essential elements into a singular, coherent directive. This refined instruction should encapsulate the primary intents of the originals, presenting them in a manner that is both clear and comprehensible to field experts. Ensure that the synthesized directive remains true to the original purposes, with any necessary expansions or clarifications included to guarantee precision, accessibility, and effectiveness in task execution.
----------
4->Condense the primary goals from the original directives into a unified, clear directive. Maintain the original intent's fidelity, improve readability, and cater to an expert audience. Deliver a succinct yet all-encompassing directive, incorporating requisite details or clarifications to ensure accuracy and enable precise task completion.
----------
5->Synthesize the objectives from both original instructions, distilling the essence while enhancing precision and coherence. Integrate the most effective elements from each, ensuring the final directive is unambiguous, exhaustive, and conducive to expert comprehension. The aim is to formulate a singular, improved instruction that retains the fundamental objectives and facilitates accurate and streamlined task execution.
----------
6->Combine the objectives from the original directives, refining key elements to form a singular, streamlined directive. Ensure the new instruction maintains fidelity to the original intents while enhancing readability and comprehension for specialists.

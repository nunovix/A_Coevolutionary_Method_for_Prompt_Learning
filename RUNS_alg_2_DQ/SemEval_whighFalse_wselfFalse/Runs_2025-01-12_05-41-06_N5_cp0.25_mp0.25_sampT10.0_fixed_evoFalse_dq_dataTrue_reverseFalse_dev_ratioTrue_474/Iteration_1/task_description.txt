0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Assess semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements put forth by clinical domain experts.

To establish entailment, statements should be supported by the CTR information and not contradict any of the provided descriptions. The CTRs contain four key sections:

1. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: specifies conditions for patient inclusion.
2. INTERVENTION: details treatments from different patient cohorts.
3. RESULTS: summarizes participant statistics and trial outcomes.
4. ADVERSE EVENTS: lists observed signs and symptoms.

Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.

2->Evaluate the semantic entailment between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, encompassing four sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, supported by CTR information and not contradicting any descriptions, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two CTRs.

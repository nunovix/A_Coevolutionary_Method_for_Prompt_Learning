0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical expert assertions, with a focus on assessing the effectiveness and safety profiles of novel therapeutics. The analysis should encompass: (1) Eligibility Criteria, specifying patient inclusion/exclusion parameters, (2) Intervention, detailing therapeutic specifics including modality, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment length, (3) Results, encapsulating participant data, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and derived conclusions, and (4) Adverse Events, recording any observed clinical signs and symptoms. Verify that expert assertions align with, are corroborated by, and do not conflict with CTR data for individual or comparative evaluations of CTRs.
----------
2->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims, with a focus on assessing the effectiveness and safety profiles of novel treatments. The analysis should encompass: (1) Eligibility Criteria, specifying patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, (2) Intervention, detailing the treatment type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) Results, providing a summary of participant data, outcome measures, units of measurement, and derived conclusions, and (4) Adverse Events, noting any observed adverse reactions and symptoms. Verify that expert claims align with, are supported by, and do not contradict CTR data for individual or comparative evaluations.
----------
3->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, with a focus on verifying the effectiveness and safety profiles of novel treatments. The analysis should encompass: (1) Evaluation of Eligibility Criteria, scrutinizing patient inclusion/exclusion parameters, (2) Examination of Interventions, specifying treatment particulars such as modality, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment span, (3) Appraisal of Results, including participant demographics, outcome indicators, units of measurement, and derived conclusions, and (4) Compilation of Adverse Events, documenting any witnessed signs and symptoms. Ensure that expert claims are corroborated by CTR data, align with clinical trial results, and remain congruent with the provided descriptions.
----------
4->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment evaluation between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and established clinical assertions, assessing the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles of novel interventions. The analysis must encompass: (1) Eligibility Criteria, specifying patient inclusion/exclusion parameters, (2) Intervention Details, describing the therapeutic modality, dosage, administration schedule, and treatment length, (3) Results Summary, encapsulating participant statistics, outcome indicators, measurement units, and findings, and (4) Adverse Event Documentation, recording any noted clinical signs and symptoms. Verify that expert claims align with CTR data, are corroborated by the reports, and are coherent with the detailed descriptions for singular or comparative CTR analyses.

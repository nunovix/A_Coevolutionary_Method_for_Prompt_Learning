0->Consider the problem of combining two different textual instructions, pertaining to the same task. The objective is to rephrase the main information common to the two descriptions, while keeping their meaning and intent. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The combined instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The combined instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instructions. Considering the aforementioned task description, combine the two textual instructions shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.

2->Rephrase and synthesize the core information from two distinct textual instructions related to the same task, aiming to preserve their essence and purpose. This synthesized directive should be tailored for a knowledgeable audience, potentially offering a condensed summary or an extended, elucidated version of the instructions, devoid of inaccuracies. Strive for clarity and directness in articulating the task execution, outperforming the initial instructions in explicative quality.
----------
3->Create a refined guideline for professionals, merging insights from two provided examples on rephrasing tasks. The guideline should reflect the essential content shared between the initial instructions, preserving their original purpose and meaning. It should be concise or detailed, with added explanations and clarifications as necessary, ensuring accuracy is paramount. The guideline must be straightforward, improving comprehension over the initial examples.
----------
4->Create an advanced, expert-oriented manual that extracts and clarifies the primary focus and critical components from the original guidelines. This manual should maintain the primary aim, key specifics, and necessary precision, exceeding the initial versions in clarity and depth. Designed for informed readers, it should ensure the highest accuracy, providing a clear summary or detailed explanation of the central task to improve instructional clarity.

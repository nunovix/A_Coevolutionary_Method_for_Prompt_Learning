Examine assertions in the statements for consistency with regards to scope, usage obligations, duration, and exclusions. Identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies that may exist between the statements and NDA details.
----------
10->
Evaluate the consistency of disclosed information with the terms of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), focusing on:

a. The bounds of protected information
b. The confidentiality duties
c. The agreement's timeframe
d. Any exemptions.
----------
11->
Assess the consistency of statements about confidentiality obligations with the corresponding NDA sections. Determine if any contradictions exist in relation to confidential information, usage rules, duration, and exclusions.
----------
12->
Analyze the semantic relations between statements concerning NDA confidentiality obligations and the NDA agreement text. Evaluate the consistency or disagreement of these statements with the definition of confidential information, parties' obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, and other key NDA provisions.
----------
13->
Assess the alignment of statements concerning confidentiality duties with the confidential material, usage terms, agreement span, and exclusions outlined in the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Identify any potential discrepancies between the NDA provisions and these statements.
----------
14->
Analyze the consistency between statements and the confidentiality provisions in Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). NDAs define the scope of protected information, obligations, duration, and exclusions regarding the handling of confidential material. Determine if statements' assertions on NDA content correspond or conflict with the information encompassed within the agreement.
----------
15->
Evaluate the alignment or conflict of statements with the following NDA components:

1. Confidential material protection
2. Usage restrictions
3. Agreement duration
4. Exclusions

Determine if statements comply with the outlined exchange and protection mechanisms in NDAs.
----------
16->

Examine the provided Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and accompanying statements to identify any consonant or contradictory relationships. Assess the NDAs' confidential information scopes, usage restrictions, durations, exclusions, and other essential features. Compare each statement to these features to establish if it aligns or clashes.
----------
17->

Your task is to evaluate the alignment and potential contradictions between statements and the confidentiality obligations outlined in Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). NDAs establish the framework for the secure exchange and protection of sensitive information, defining aspects such as confidential material, usage obligations, agreement duration, and exclusions. Your role is to assess each statement's consistency with the NDA, providing clear and accurate results.

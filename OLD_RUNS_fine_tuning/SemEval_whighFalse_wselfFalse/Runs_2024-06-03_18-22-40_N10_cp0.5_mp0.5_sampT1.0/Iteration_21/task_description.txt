0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Execute a thorough semantic evaluation of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical expert assertions, analyzing trial methodologies and results to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Ensure that expert claims regarding individual CTRs or comparative analyses are semantically underpinned by data from the CTRs, corroborated by the reports, and consistent with the detailed trial information provided.
----------
2->

Execute a detailed semantic analysis linking Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with expert clinical assertions, scrutinizing clinical trial methodologies and results to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Ensure that expert statements regarding specific CTRs or comparative analyses are semantically supported by empirical evidence, substantiated by data in the CTRs, and consistent with the detailed trial descriptions.

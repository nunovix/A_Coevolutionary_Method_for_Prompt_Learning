0->Evaluate the credibility of health-related claims from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Critically analyze the four essential sections of a CTR: (1) Participant Inclusion Criteria, (2) Treatment Details, including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Participant Outcomes, summarizing demographics, results, measurements, and observations, and (4) Recorded Adverse Events, noting any negative reactions. Use data from a single Clinical Trial Report or compare two to ensure a comprehensive and unambiguous assessment for medical professionals.

3->Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of new medical treatments by analyzing key sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs): (1) Participant Selection Criteria, (2) Treatment Regimen, (3) Participant Outcomes, and (4) Recorded Adverse Events. Base your assessment on data from one CTR or a comparative analysis of two CTRs, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for medical professionals.
----------
4->Evaluate the validity of health-related assertions found within distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). These reports provide insights into the efficacy and safety profiles of emerging medical therapies. The structure of CTRs encompasses four principal components: (1) Eligibility Criteria for Participants, detailing the qualifications required for trial enrollment, (2) Treatment Protocol, outlining the specifics of the administered treatment.

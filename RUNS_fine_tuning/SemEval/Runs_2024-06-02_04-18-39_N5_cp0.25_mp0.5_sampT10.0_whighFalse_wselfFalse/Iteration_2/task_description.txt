0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
2->

Conduct a semantic entailment analysis correlating specific segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with assertions made by clinical experts. Analyze CTRs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new medical treatments. Compare these findings with expert claims regarding one or more CTR sections, ensuring consistency with clinical trial data, substantiation from the CTR, and absence of contradictions with provided descriptions.
----------
3->

Identify and elucidate the supportive associations between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical assertions. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and results of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Break down CTRs into four key components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing inclusion and exclusion criteria for trial participants, (2) INTERVENTION, describing the specific treatment type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and trial conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any observed signs and symptoms. Analyze and substantiate clinical claims based on these components, either for a single CTR or in comparative analysis between two.

4->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by specialists in the clinical field. CTRs detail the procedures and results of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. The assertions, conversely, make specific claims about the information contained within one or more sections of CTRs, either for a single report or for a comparative evaluation of multiple reports. For entailment verification, ensure that the claim corresponds with the clinical trial data, is substantiated by the CTR, and does not conflict with the given descriptions.

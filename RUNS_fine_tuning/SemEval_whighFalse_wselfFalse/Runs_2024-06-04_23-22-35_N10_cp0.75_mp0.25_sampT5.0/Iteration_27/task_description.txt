0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.

1->

Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on methodology, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcomes, and adverse reactions. Analyze one to two patient groups per report, emphasizing varied therapeutic methods and initial conditions. Break down each CTR into four key sections: (1) patient enrollment criteria, (2) intervention details including modality, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) results summary with participant count, outcome measures, units, and findings, and (4) adverse reactions listing observed symptoms. Ensure expert assertions are consistent with these sections, validating statements without contradicting the CTRs. Confirm entailment by ensuring claims are clinically relevant, supported by CTRs, and non-contradictory.

2->

Execute a detailed semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, focusing on trial methodologies, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, conclusions, and adverse event documentation. Confirm that expert statements are clinically pertinent, data-backed, and adhere to stringent standards for singular or comparative analysis of CTRs. Validate clinical relevance, data accuracy, and content consistency across all CTR sections—eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events—against expert assertions.

3->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, meticulously examining trial methodologies, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, conclusions, and adverse event documentation. Ensure expert statements are clinically relevant, substantiated by data, and comply with rigorous standards for singular or comparative analysis of CTRs. Rigorously validate clinical relevance, data integrity, and content uniformity across all CTR sections—eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events—against expert assertions. Additionally, provide comprehensive definitions and clarifications where necessary for an expert audience.

4->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements, focusing on methodologies, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, conclusions, and adverse event documentation. Confirm that expert claims are clinically relevant, data-backed, and adhere to stringent standards for both individual and comparative analysis of CTR sections—eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events—against expert assertions without introducing inconsistencies.

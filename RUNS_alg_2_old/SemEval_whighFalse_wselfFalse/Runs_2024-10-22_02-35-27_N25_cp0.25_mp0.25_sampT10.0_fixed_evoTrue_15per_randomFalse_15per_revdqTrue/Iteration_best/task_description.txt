0->The objective is to examine semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements articulated by clinical domain experts. CTRs elaborate on the procedures and findings of clinical trials, which aim at assessing treatment effectiveness and safety. Each trial involves cohorts of patients exposed to distinct treatments or exhibiting diverse baseline characteristics. Comprehensive CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, delineating conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detaining the treatments, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, cataloging relevant observations. Statements posit claims regarding the clinical information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. Establishing entailment requires assessing if the statements are compatible with the clinical trial data, avoiding any contradictions with the CTRs.

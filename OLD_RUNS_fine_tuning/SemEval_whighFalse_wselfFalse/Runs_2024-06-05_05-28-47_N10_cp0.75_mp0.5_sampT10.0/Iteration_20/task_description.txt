0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis linking expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Thoroughly scrutinize the methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse reactions detailed in the CTRs. Accurately depict expert evaluations concerning individual or comparative CTRs, grounded in CTR data and in agreement with the given descriptions. Rigorously confirm the logical relationships between expert opinions and CTR extracts, ensuring all claims are substantiated by evidence from the CTR and are consistent with the provided descriptions.
----------
2->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis merging expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), thoroughly examining methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Accurately depict expert analyses on individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring these analyses are evidence-based, substantiated by CTR data, and consistent with the provided descriptions. Critically assess the logical connections between expert statements and CTR excerpts, confirming that claims are evidence-based, supported by the CTR, and consistent with the provided descriptions, without any contradictions.
----------
3->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis, leveraging advanced medical expertise and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), scrutinizing methodologies, results, therapeutic effectiveness, safety profiles, participant selection criteria, trial protocols, outcomes, and adverse reactions. Accurately depict expert evaluations on singular or comparative CTRs, ensuring analyses are data-driven, corroborated by CTR findings, and aligned with the given descriptions. Rigorously assess the logical correlations between expert commentary and CTR segments, confirming that assertions are evidence-based, supported by CTR data, and consistent with the provided descriptions.

4->"

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis by synthesizing expert medical knowledge with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on methodologies, results, treatment efficacy, safety, participant selection, protocols, outcomes, and adverse effects. Accurately depict expert analyses concerning individual or comparative CTRs, ensuring these analyses are evidence-based, directly supported by CTR data, and aligned with the initial descriptions. Rigorously assess the logical relationships between expert statements and CTR excerpts, confirming that claims are evidence-based, substantiated by CTR data, and consistent with the provided descriptions.

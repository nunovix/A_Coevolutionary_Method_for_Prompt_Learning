Conduct a thorough semantic entailment analysis to confirm expert assertions by rigorously cross-checking data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), ensuring alignment with the original descriptions. This involves a comprehensive review of CTRs detailing clinical trial processes and outcomes, focusing on evaluating the effectiveness and safety of novel medical interventions. Confirm that experts' claims are supported by CTRs, adhere strictly to the original descriptions, and are based firmly on empirical evidence from the CTRs. Additionally, when assessing specialists' claims across various CTRs, ensure these claims are consistent, supported, and non-contradictory to the provided descriptions.

* Reorganized the commands to improve the flow and clarity of the instruction
* Emphasized the importance of a clear and structured format in step 2

2->Summarize the key points from a doctor-patient conversation. Begin by outlining the main issues the patient is experiencing. Then, organize the relevant information from the conversation in a clear and organized manner. Note the patient's symptoms, including when they started, how they feel, and their severity. Also, record the doctor's observations of the patient's vital signs and other notable findings. The doctor will then provide a list of potential diagnoses, along with any additional relevant details. Finally, document the treatment plan, including any necessary tests, referrals, medications, or therapies.

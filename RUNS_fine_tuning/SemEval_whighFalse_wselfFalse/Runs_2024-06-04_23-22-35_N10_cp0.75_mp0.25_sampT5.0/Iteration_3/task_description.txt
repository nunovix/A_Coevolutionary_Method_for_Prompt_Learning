0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.

1->Analyze the semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert assertions in the clinical field. CTRs document the methodology and results of clinical trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. Each CTR includes data from 1-2 patient cohorts, which may differ in treatment regimens and baseline characteristics. The CTRs are divided into four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant numbers, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms during the trial. Expert assertions should correlate with these sections for a single CTR or in comparative analyses between two CTRs. To establish entailment, claims must be related to the CTR content, supported by the CTR data, and consistent with the provided descriptions.
----------
2->Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert assertions, examining methodologies, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, conclusions, and documented adverse events. Ensure expert claims are clinically relevant, substantiated by CTR evidence, and consistent with the detailed descriptions of individual or comparative CTR evaluations.
----------
3->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert claims, scrutinizing methodologies, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, conclusions, and documented adverse events. Verify that expert assertions are clinically pertinent, backed by evidence from CTRs, and align with the defined criteria for singular or comparative CTR assessments.

4->"

Execute a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert claims, meticulously examining methodologies, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, conclusions, and documented adverse events. Ensure expert assertions are clinically relevant, evidence-backed, and consistent with the designated criteria for individual or comparative CTR assessments.

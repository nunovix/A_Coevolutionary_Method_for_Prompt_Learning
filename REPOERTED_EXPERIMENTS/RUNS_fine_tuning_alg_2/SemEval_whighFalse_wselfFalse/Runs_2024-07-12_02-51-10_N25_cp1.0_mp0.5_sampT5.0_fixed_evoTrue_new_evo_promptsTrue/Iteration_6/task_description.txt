0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Analyze clinical trial reports (CTRs), which are divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Determine if expert statements about these sections are semantically entailed by the CTRs, ensuring no contradictions are present.
----------
2->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to ensure Expert Commentary on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS is semantically consistent without contradictions.
----------
3->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), ensuring expert commentary corresponds with Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events, without discrepancies.
----------
4->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on four key areas: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Verify that expert commentary aligns with these sections, maintaining consistency and avoiding contradictions.
----------
5->Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to ensure semantic consistency across Expert Commentary on Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Verify that clinical statements accurately reflect the methodology, findings, effectiveness, and safety of new treatments as detailed in the respective sections of the CTRs.

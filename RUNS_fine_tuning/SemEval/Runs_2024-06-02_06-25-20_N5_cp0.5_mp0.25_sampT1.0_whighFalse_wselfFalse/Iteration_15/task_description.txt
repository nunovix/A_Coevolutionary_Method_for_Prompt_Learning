Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and domain expert statements to ascertain semantic entailment or support. Focus on four CTR sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant count, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed patient signs and symptoms. Cross-examine these sections with expert statements, ensuring claims are consistent with, supported by, and non-contradictory to the CTRs' content.

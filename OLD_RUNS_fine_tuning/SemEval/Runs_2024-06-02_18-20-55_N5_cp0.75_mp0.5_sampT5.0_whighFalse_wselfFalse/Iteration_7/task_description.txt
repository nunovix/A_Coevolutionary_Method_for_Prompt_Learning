0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert claims, meticulously examining trial protocols, results, therapeutic effectiveness, and safety. Decompose CTRs into the following components: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (patient inclusion conditions), INTERVENTION (treatment specifics: type, dosage, frequency, duration), RESULTS (participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, findings), and ADVERSE EVENTS (observed signs and symptoms). Verify that expert statements align with CTR data, are supported by the reports, and are consistent with the provided descriptions.
----------
2->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert claims regarding trial protocols, outcomes, therapeutic efficacy, and safety. Dissect CTRs into four categories: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (patient inclusion conditions), INTERVENTION (treatment specifics including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), RESULTS (participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and findings), and ADVERSE EVENTS (observed signs and symptoms). Verify that expert assertions are in agreement with CTR data, are supported by the reports, and do not conflict with the provided descriptions.

3->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert assertions regarding trial protocols, outcomes, therapeutic efficacy, and safety. Scrutinize CTRs segmented into ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (patient inclusion conditions), INTERVENTION (treatment specifics including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), RESULTS (participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and findings), and ADVERSE EVENTS (observed signs and symptoms). Verify that expert statements are congruent with CTR data, are corroborated by the reports, and do not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
4->

Conduct an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative expert commentary, scrutinizing trial protocols, outcomes, therapeutic efficacy, and safety. Dissect CTRs into ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (patient inclusion conditions), INTERVENTION (treatment specifics: type, dosage, frequency, duration), RESULTS (participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, findings), and ADVERSE EVENTS (observed signs and symptoms). Validate that expert commentary is in harmony with CTR data, is corroborated by the reports, and remains consistent with the provided descriptions.

0->Analyze clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining patient eligibility requirements; (2) INTERVENTION, describing the intervention's type, dosage, frequency, and duration; (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions; and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any unexpected adverse events. Formulate statements based on these sections for a single CTR or for comparative analysis between two CTRs.

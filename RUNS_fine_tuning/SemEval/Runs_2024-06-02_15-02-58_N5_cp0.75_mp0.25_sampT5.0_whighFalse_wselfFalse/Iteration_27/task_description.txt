0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert claims and data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), specifically examining ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Undertake meticulous individual and comparative evaluations to corroborate expert assertions with CTR information, referencing exact CTR excerpts as proof. Verify that the analysis corroborates, substantiates, and concurs with the initial expert claims, while avoiding any contradictions.
----------
2->Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between expert claims and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Conduct detailed individual and comparative assessments to validate expert assertions against clinical trial data, referencing specific CTR sections as evidence. Confirm that these analyses substantiate, reinforce, and maintain congruence with the initial expert claims, ensuring consistency and the absence of contradictions.
----------
3->Conduct an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between expert statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), examining eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, trial outcomes, and recorded adverse events. This should encompass both singular and comparative assessments to ascertain that expert assertions are consistent with CTR data, substantiated by pertinent CTR excerpts. Ensure the analysis upholds, corroborates, and guarantees congruence with the original expert claims, meticulously avoiding discrepancies.
----------
4->

Execute a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert claims and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), scrutinizing ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Undertake meticulous individual and comparative evaluations to corroborate expert assertions with clinical trial data, referencing pertinent excerpts from CTRs for substantiation. Ensure these analyses affirm, bolster, and maintain consistency with the initial expert claims, steering clear of contradictions.

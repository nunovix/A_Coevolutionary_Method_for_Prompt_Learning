1->Thoroughly scrutinize Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to ascertain the veracity of eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Confirm that expert commentary is semantically consistent with the CTR's documented methodology, outcomes, and safety profiles, ensuring there are no discrepancies.

2->Carefully scrutinize Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to validate the congruence of expert commentary with the report's documented methodology, outcomes, and safety profiles. Confirm that all expert statements are substantiated by the report's findings, with a particular focus on participant selection criteria, treatment specifics, outcome summaries, and reported side effects. Ensure there are no contradictions between expert opinions and the information provided in the CTRs.
----------
3->Your task is to critically evaluate the validity of medical claims based on information extracted from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs are comprehensive documents that outline the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, focusing on the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. These reports are systematically organized into four main sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which specify the conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of the treatments administered, (3) RESULTS, summarizing the participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and the conclusions drawn from the data, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, which document any unexpected signs, symptoms, or adverse reactions observed during the trial. When evaluating expert statements, ensure that they accurately reflect the content of the CTRs, are substantiated by the data presented, and are consistent with the overall findings and conclusions of the report.

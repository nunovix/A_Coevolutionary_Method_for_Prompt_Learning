1->You are tasked with creating a clinical note from the transcription of a dialogue between a physician and a patient. Your summary should capture the essence of the conversation, organizing the information into sections. Begin by documenting the patient's main complaint and the relevant medical history. Next, present objective and measurable findings, followed by the doctor's assessment of the information given by the patient, and the corresponding diagnosis. Finally, present the strategy for medication management, and outline the follow-up plan for patient monitoring.

2->Create a clinical note by distilling key points from a physician-patient conversation. Summarize the patient's primary concern and medical background, followed by the objective data collected and the doctor's interpretation. Document the patient's symptoms, diagnosis, and the doctor's assessment. Outline the treatment plan and schedule follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress.

3->Summarize a clinical dialogue between a doctor and a patient, focusing on key elements. Describe the patient's chief complaints, including onset, chronology, quality, and severity. Record measurable and objective facts, such as vital signs and findings. Document the doctor's interpretation, including a list of diagnoses with relevant attributes. Outline the treatment plan, including necessary investigations, referrals, medications, and therapies.
----------
4->Draft a medical note for an encounter between a healthcare provider and a patient. Attend to the most relevant information from a transcript of the conversation, identifying key clinical concepts such as medications, diseases, conditions, injuries, signs and symptoms. Structure the note according to standard formats, such as SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) or APSO (assessment, plan, subjective, objective). Be thorough, clear, and brief. You'll also be provided with an example note so you can know the structure we are looking for in the note.

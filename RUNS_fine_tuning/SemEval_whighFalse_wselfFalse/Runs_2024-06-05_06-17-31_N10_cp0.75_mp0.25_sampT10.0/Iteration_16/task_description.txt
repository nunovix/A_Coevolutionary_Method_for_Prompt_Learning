0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic evaluation to correlate data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines, verifying the therapeutic effectiveness and safety characteristics. Validate that expert assertions on inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention particulars, results, and adverse event documentation across singular or aggregated CTRs are consistent, logically coherent, and non-contradictory with recognized clinical expertise.
----------
2->

Perform an in-depth semantic analysis to establish correlations between segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines. Validate the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles as stated in both sources. Confirm that expert claims regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse event documentation are consistent across individual and comparative analyses of CTRs. Maintain logical coherence, avoid contradictions, and ensure alignment with established clinical expertise.

3->

Perform an in-depth semantic analysis correlating segments within Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical documents to verify therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Align findings with expert claims on eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse event documentation in both individual and comparative CTR analyses. Ensure logical coherence, non-contradiction, and consistency with expert clinical assertions regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse events.

4->

Perform a comprehensive semantic analysis to align segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines, confirming therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Ensure that expert claims regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse event records across individual or multiple CTRs are consistent, logically coherent, and non-contradictory with established clinical expertise.

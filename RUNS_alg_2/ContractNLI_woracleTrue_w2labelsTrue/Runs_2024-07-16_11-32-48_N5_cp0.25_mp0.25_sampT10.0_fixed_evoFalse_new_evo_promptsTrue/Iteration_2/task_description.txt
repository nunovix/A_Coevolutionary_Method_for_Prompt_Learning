0->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.
----------
1->Conduct a thorough examination of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) to ascertain the presence and specifics of affirming or conflicting clauses pertaining to confidentiality responsibilities. NDAs delineate the procedures for managing sensitive data, identify what is deemed confidential information, describe the authorized utilization of this information, indicate the term length of the agreement, and explicate any exceptions to the agreement's purview. Evaluate the coherence of individual statements with or against the stipulations set forth in the NDAs.

2->Your objective is to analyze a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to ascertain the semantic entailment between specific sections of the NDA and assertions about its confidentiality obligations. Carefully examine the NDA to identify the definition of confidential information, the obligations of the involved parties, the duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other relevant clauses. Determine if statements regarding these elements are either substantiated or refuted by the NDA content. Ensure that your analysis is thorough, precise, and provides clear guidance on the entailment between the NDA sections and the assertions about confidentiality obligations.

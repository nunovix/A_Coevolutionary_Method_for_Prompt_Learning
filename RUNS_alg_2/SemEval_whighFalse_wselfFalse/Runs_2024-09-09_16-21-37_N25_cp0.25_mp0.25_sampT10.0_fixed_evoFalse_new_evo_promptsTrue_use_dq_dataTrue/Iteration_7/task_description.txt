1->Critically analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify claims about eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events, ensuring accuracy for single or comparative evaluations.
----------
2->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to confirm the accuracy of eligibility criteria, interventions, outcomes, and reported adverse events for individual or comparative assessments.
----------
3->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to confirm the accuracy of stated eligibility requirements, treatments administered, outcomes, and any negative effects, suitable for individual or side-by-side assessments.
----------
4->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.

5-> effectiveness and safety. Expert statements make assertions about specific CTR sections or compare two CTRs. Validate entailment by ensuring statements are supported by CTR data and do not conflict with the report

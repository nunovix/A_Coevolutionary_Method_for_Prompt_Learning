0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Execute a comprehensive semantic entailment assessment between authoritative clinical claims and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Validate that these expert declarations are corroborated and non-conflicting with CTRs' Eligibility Criteria, Interventions, Results, and Adverse Events sections. Ensure consistency across various CTRs for individual and comparative analyses.
----------
2->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between expert clinical statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), verifying consistency and non-contradiction concerning Eligibility Criteria, Interventions, Results, and Adverse Events. Ensure expert assertions are harmonized across various CTRs for coherent individual and comparative analyses.
----------
3->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert-level clinical statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), verifying that these statements are consistent and non-contradictory with respect to the CTRs' Eligibility Criteria, Interventions, Results, and Adverse Events sections. Furthermore, evaluate the consistency of expert statements across different CTRs to improve both individual and comparative analysis skills.

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->

Perform an in-depth semantic analysis to establish correlations between data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and established clinical guidelines. Confirm the therapeutic efficacy and safety parameters. Cross-examine these findings with expert assertions on eligibility criteria, specific interventions, expected outcomes, and documented adverse events in both singular and comparative analyses of CTRs. Uphold logical consistency, avoid contradictions, and ensure congruence with expert clinical claims concerning eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse event reporting.
----------
2->

Perform an exhaustive semantic evaluation to establish connections between segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines. Confirm the therapeutic effectiveness and safety parameters. Authenticate and synchronize expert assertions regarding eligibility criteria, intervention details, results, and adverse event records in both individual and comparative analyses of CTRs. Maintain logical consistency, absence of contradiction, and adherence to recognized clinical expertise.
----------
3->

Execute a comprehensive semantic analysis to align data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines, confirming therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Ensure expert claims regarding eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, outcomes, and adverse event documentation across individual and comparative CTR analyses are consistent, logically coherent, and in agreement with established clinical expertise.
----------
4->

Execute a comprehensive semantic evaluation to correlate data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical guidelines, verifying therapeutic effectiveness and safety characteristics. Validate consistency, logical coherence, and non-contradiction of expert assertions on inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention specifics, results, and adverse event documentation across singular or aggregated CTR analyses, ensuring alignment with established clinical expertise.

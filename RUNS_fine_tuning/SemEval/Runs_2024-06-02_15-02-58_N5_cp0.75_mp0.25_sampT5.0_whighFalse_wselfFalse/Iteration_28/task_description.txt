0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->Conduct an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between expert statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), examining eligibility criteria, intervention specifics, trial outcomes, and recorded adverse events. This should encompass both singular and comparative assessments to ascertain that expert assertions are consistent with CTR data, substantiated by pertinent CTR excerpts. Ensure the analysis upholds, corroborates, and guarantees congruence with the original expert claims, meticulously avoiding discrepancies.
----------
2->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert claims and data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), specifically examining ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Undertake meticulous individual and comparative evaluations to corroborate expert assertions with CTR information, referencing exact CTR excerpts as proof. Verify that the analysis corroborates, substantiates, and concurs with the initial expert claims, while avoiding any contradictions.
----------
3->

Execute a detailed semantic entailment analysis between expert claims and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. This analysis should include both individual and comparative evaluations to validate expert assertions against CTR data, supported by exact excerpts from the CTRs. Ensure the analysis corroborates, substantiates, and aligns precisely with the original expert claims, meticulously preventing any contradictions.
----------
4->

Execute a thorough semantic entailment analysis between expert claims and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, TRIAL RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Engage in detailed individual and comparative evaluations to validate expert statements against CTR data, citing specific excerpts from CTRs as evidence. Confirm that the analysis corroborates, substantiates, and aligns precisely with the initial expert claims, ensuring no contradictions are present.

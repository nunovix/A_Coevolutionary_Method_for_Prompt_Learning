0->Your task is to evaluate the credibility of clinical statements by carefully examining specific components of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs provide in-depth information about clinical trials, including the efficacy and safety of new treatments. These reports are structured into four main categories: (1) eligibility criteria, (2) intervention details, (3) results summaries, and (4) adverse event listings. Statements within CTRs make explicit claims about the information in these categories, either for a single report or for comparative analyses between multiple reports.

0->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content.

1->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. Note that NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether a statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA content. You are tasked with identifying support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about these contents, and your task is to assess if these claims are supported or contradicted in the NDA.

2->Determine the semantic entailment relations between specific sections of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and statements regarding confidentiality obligations. To achieve this, analyze the NDA's content, focusing on key aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other relevant terms. Identify the support relationships between these sections and the statements, assessing whether each statement is supported or contradicted by the NDA's content. Specifically, examine the framework for sharing and protecting sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, and agreement duration, to evaluate the validity of claims made about these contents.

3->Analyze the relationship between NDA provisions and statements about confidentiality to identify supported or contradicted claims. NDAs specify how sensitive information is shared and protected, including definitions, party obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, and other key terms. Evaluate NDA content to determine if a statement aligns with or contradicts the agreement's terms.

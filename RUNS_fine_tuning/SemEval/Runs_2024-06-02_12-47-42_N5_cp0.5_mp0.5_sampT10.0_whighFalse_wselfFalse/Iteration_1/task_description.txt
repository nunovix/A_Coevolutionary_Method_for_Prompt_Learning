0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->Analyze semantic entailment relationships between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. CTRs document clinical trial methodologies and findings to evaluate new treatment effectiveness and safety. Trials consist of cohorts receiving varied treatments or possessing different baseline characteristics. Comprehensive CTRs include four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA detailing patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION outlining treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed patient signs and symptoms. Statements made by clinical experts claim information within these sections for individual or comparative CTR analysis. To confirm entailment, a statement must align with clinical trial data, be corroborated by the CTR, and not contradict provided descriptions.

2->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
3->Your objective is to discern semantic entailment connections between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements made by domain experts. Entailment is established when a statement's claim is substantiated by the CTR, without contradicting expert descriptions. CTRs detail clinical trials' methodologies and findings, assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Comprising four sections, CTRs include: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA outlining patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements claim information within these sections for a single CTR or in comparative analyses between two CTRs.
----------
4->Analyze the semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-issued statements, focusing on the efficacy and safety assessments of novel treatments within clinical trials. CTRs are dissected into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA outlining patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION DETAILS specifying treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS SUMMARY detailing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Expert statements claim information within these sections for individual or comparative CTR analysis. To validate entailment, ensure the statement's claim is consistent with clinical trial data, supported by the CTR, and non-contradictory to the descriptions.

Conduct a semantic entailment analysis correlating segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with authoritative clinical statements, specifically targeting eligibility criteria, interventions, outcomes, adverse events, and treatment efficacy and safety. Ensure expert statements align with clinical definitions, uphold consistency and non-contradiction across both individual and aggregated CTRs, and are empirically substantiated by CTR data. Validate entailment by matching expert claims with CTR methodologies and findings across designated sections in a single or multiple CTRs.

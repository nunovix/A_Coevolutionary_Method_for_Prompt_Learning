0->Think about the task of merging two different textual descriptions for the same problem. The goal is to rephrase the main information that is common to both descriptions, leveraging the best elements from each while preserving their meaning and intent. Your task is to generate a concise and direct instruction that communicates the necessary steps for task execution more clearly than the original versions. This requires careful consideration of the language and details used in both instructions, to ensure that the rephrased version is not only succinct, but also informative and easy to understand. The end result should be a streamlined instruction that experts in the field can follow with ease and confidence.
----------
1->Consider how to combine two separate textual instructions for the same task. The primary objective is to rephrase the main information that is common to both descriptions, using different words and changing the ordering of the statements, while ensuring that their meaning and intent remain intact. It is important to include all relevant details from both instructions, regardless of whether this makes the final instruction longer. The resulting instruction should be clear, comprehensive, and informative, providing a thorough guide for task execution. This means paying attention to nuances and specific details in both texts, integrating them seamlessly to produce a unified directive that leaves no room for ambiguity. The final instruction should be detailed enough to cater to experts in the field, ensuring they have all the information needed to perform the task efficiently.
----------
2->You are tasked with merging two different instructions that aim at the same objective. You should rephrase the core information that is common to both descriptions, taking the best ideas from each and building upon them to enhance clarity (e.g., by replacing words, deleting irrelevant parts, or changing the ordering of the statements). You have the freedom to add further explanations and clarifications where necessary, as long as the final instruction remains clear, comprehensive, easy to follow, and true to the original intent. The goal is to create a combined instruction that not only preserves the essential information from both descriptions, but also improves upon it, making it easier for experts in the field to execute the task accurately and efficiently.
----------
3->Reflect on the challenge of blending two different directions that pertain to the same activity. Your objective is to rephrase the main information that is common to both descriptions, utilizing the best parts from each while maintaining the overall intent. It is essential to ensure that the final instruction is clear and instills confidence in those executing the task. This involves carefully selecting the most effective elements from both sets of directions, integrating them into a coherent and supportive instruction. The resulting directive should not only be easy to follow but should also provide reassurance and clarity, enabling experts to carry out the task with confidence and precision. Focus on creating an instruction that is both motivational and informative, fostering a sense of assurance in the task's successful completion while at the same time being very direct and consise.
----------
4->Combine the key points from the provided descriptions into a succinct, expert-level directive that maintains the original purpose and delivers a clear, precise guide for task execution.
----------
5->Synthesize the essential elements from both provided directions, ensuring a clear, concise, and comprehensive guide for experts to execute the task with confidence and precision. Incorporate the most effective ideas, refine the language for improved clarity, and maintain fidelity to the original objectives. Enhance the instruction with necessary definitions and clarifications to facilitate accurate and efficient task completion.
----------
6->Combine the key points from the two provided textual descriptions into a single, coherent instruction. Ensure that the essence and objectives of the original instructions are maintained. Present the consolidated instruction in a clear, concise, and expert-friendly manner.

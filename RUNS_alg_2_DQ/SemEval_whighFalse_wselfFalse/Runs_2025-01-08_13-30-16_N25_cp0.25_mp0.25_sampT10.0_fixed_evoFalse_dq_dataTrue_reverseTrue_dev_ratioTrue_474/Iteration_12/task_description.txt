0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Trials involve patient groups, called cohorts or arms, which may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. A complete CTR contains 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Assess semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. CTRs consist of four sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. To establish entailment, statements must be supported by CTR information and not contradict any provided descriptions.
----------
2->To establish semantic entailment relations between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, analyze the relationships between four key sections of a CTR: eligibility criteria, intervention descriptions, results summaries, and adverse event listings. Expert statements, typically in the form of sentences, make claims about specific CTR sections, either individually or in comparison. For entailment to be established, these claims must be grounded in the CTR data, align with the provided descriptions, and avoid contradictions.
----------
3->Determine semantic entailment relations between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical experts. A CTR consists of four sections: eligibility criteria, intervention details, results summary, and adverse events. Statements (claims) relate to one or more CTR sections, are supported by the CTR, and do not contradict its descriptions.

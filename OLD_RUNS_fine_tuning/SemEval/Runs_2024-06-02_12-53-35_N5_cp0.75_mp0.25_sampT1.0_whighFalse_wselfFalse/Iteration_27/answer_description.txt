0->Provide a YES or NO response indicating if it's possible to assess the statement's validity based on the information presented in the clinical trial report descriptions. Do this by interpreting the medical terminology and the context in both the report and the statement, carefully addressing any ambiguities or gaps in the provided information.
----------
1->

Perform an exhaustive evaluation of clinical trial assertions by scrutinizing trial data, deciphering medical terminology, and understanding contextual subtleties. Apply expertise to resolve uncertainties and supplement missing details. Indicate "Confirmed" if the claim is consistent with the data, or "Refuted" if it is not. Furthermore, deliver a clear "YES" or "NO" as to whether the statement's veracity can be determined from the clinical trial report descriptions, considering medical jargon, context, and potential ambiguities or data insufficiencies.
----------
2->

Critically assess clinical trial assertions by rigorously analyzing trial data, medical terminology, and contextual nuances. Apply domain-specific expertise to elucidate ambiguities and address data lacunae. Classify statements as "Confirmed" if they align with the trial data, or "Refuted" if they diverge. Furthermore, evaluate each statement's verifiability by interpreting clinical trial report descriptions, deciphering medical jargon and context, and resolving ambiguities and information voids with exactitude.
----------
3->

Execute a comprehensive evaluation of clinical trial claims by meticulously scrutinizing trial data, interpreting medical terminology, and understanding contextual subtleties. Utilize specialized knowledge to clarify uncertainties and fill informational gaps. Validate claims as "Confirmed" when they are consistent with the trial data, or "Refuted" when they are not. Additionally, determine definitively "YES" or "NO" regarding the certainty of a statement's validity based on the clinical trial report descriptions, taking into account medical terminology, context, and potential ambiguities or data insufficiencies.

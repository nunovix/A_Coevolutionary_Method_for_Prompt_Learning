0->Evaluate the validity of clinical assertions derived from individual segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs encapsulate the protocols and outcomes of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapies. These reports are divided into four distinct parts: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines the criteria for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing the participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and final conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any unforeseen adverse reactions. Assertions may pertain to a singular CTR or contrast findings between two.

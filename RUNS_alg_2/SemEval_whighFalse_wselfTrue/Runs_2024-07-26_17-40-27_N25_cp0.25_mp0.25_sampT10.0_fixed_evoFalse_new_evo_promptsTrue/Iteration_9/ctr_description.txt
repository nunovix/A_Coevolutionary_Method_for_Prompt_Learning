0->Focus on the pertinent details within the Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) relevant to the specific trial in question.
----------
1->Focus on extracting critical data from the specified Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) relevant to the current trial.
----------
2->Review Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify that key findings are consistent with the study's goals and maintain transparency and credibility.
----------
3->Concentrate on extracting and analyzing the critical data from the Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) that pertain directly to the trial under examination.
----------
4->Concentrate on extracting critical data from the specified Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) pertinent to the trial at hand.
----------
5->"Revise the subsequent descriptions to align with the content typically found in a standard section of a clinical trial report. Ensure that the revised instructions are clear, detailed, and leave no room for misinterpretation to facilitate optimal AI system performance during task execution."

RESULT:

The rephrased instruction now explicitly instructs the AI system to modify the descriptions to match the content usually present in a standard section of a clinical trial report. It emphasizes the need for clarity, detail, and precision to ensure the AI system can execute the task effectively without ambiguity.

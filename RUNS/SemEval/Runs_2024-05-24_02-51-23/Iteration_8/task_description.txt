0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->Evaluate the semantic entailment among segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative expert statements in the clinical domain. Ensure alignment, agreement, and lack of contradiction in clinical trial data, methodologies, findings, and terminologies.
----------
2->Assess the semantic relationship between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims by:

- Verifying that expert statements precisely correspond to and are derived from specified content within CTR segments.

- Confirming each statement through evidence extracted from CTRs to authenticate their validity.

- Preserving logical coherence and preventing any contradictions with the CTR content.
----------
3->Analyze the semantic alignment between Clinical Trial Report segments and expert clinical statements, with the following criteria:

- Verify that expert assertions are precise representations of the designated content in CTR segments.

- Corroborate each assertion with supporting evidence extracted from the CTRs, validating their truthfulness.

- Ensure coherence and eschew inconsistencies with the CTR content.
----------
4->Evaluate the semantic correlation between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions by ensuring:

- Expert statements are an exact reflection of specified content within CTR segments.

- Each statement is backed by evidence found within the CTRs, confirming their accuracy.

- Maintain logical consistency and avoid contradictions with CTR content.

CTRs summarize the results of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of new treatments. These reports are divided into four main areas: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. By examining these sections, you can assess the validity of statements made about specific CTRs or comparative analyses between two trials.

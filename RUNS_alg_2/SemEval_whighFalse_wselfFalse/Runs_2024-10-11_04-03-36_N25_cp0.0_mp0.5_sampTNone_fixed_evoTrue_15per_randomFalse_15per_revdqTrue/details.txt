Total elapsed time: 13:41:05.758190
No. of iterations: 16
Average time per iteration: 0:51:19.109887

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 25
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 0
Max no. of iterations allowed: 200
Patience: 10
Evaluation done on: dev set
With 300 examples

Label distribution: Counter({'Contradiction': 150, 'Entailment': 150})

Name of the model used: microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
Retrieving examples-->False 
Alg 2 - Random sample 2 individuals weighted on scores, apply crossover and mutation to the offspring, top 0 performers are always kept as elite population
With crossover probability 0.5 and mutation probability 0.5

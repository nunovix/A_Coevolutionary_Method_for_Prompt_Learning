0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->

Conduct a comprehensive examination of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of therapeutic interventions. Decompose each CTR into four critical components:

1. Eligibility Criteria for Participants: Detail the inclusion parameters for patient recruitment.

2. Specifics of Therapeutic Intervention: Outline the intervention type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment period.

3. Summary of Participant Demographics and Outcomes: Summarize participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and key findings.

4. Documentation of Adverse Effects: Catalog all noted adverse events or symptoms. Authenticate clinical assertions pertinent to individual CTRs or comparative analyses.
----------
2->

Identify and elucidate the supportive associations between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical assertions. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and results of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Break down CTRs into four key components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing inclusion and exclusion criteria for trial participants, (2) INTERVENTION, describing the intervention type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Analyze and substantiate clinical claims pertaining to individual CTRs or comparative analyses between two CTRs.
----------
3->

Conduct an in-depth analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to assess the therapeutic interventions' efficacy and safety. Dissect each CTR into four essential elements:

1. Enrolment Criteria: Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection.

2. Intervention Details: Describe the intervention type, exact dosage, administration schedule, and treatment duration.

3. Outcome Metrics Summary: Provide a concise overview of participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and key results.

4. Adverse Effects Documentation: Document all adverse reactions or symptoms reported, and confirm clinically relevant statements specific to each CTR and comparative evaluations.
----------
4->

Conduct a comprehensive analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of new therapeutic interventions. Dissect each CTR into four critical components:

1. Eligibility Criteria: Detail the inclusion conditions for patient enrollment.

2. Intervention Specifications: Describe the treatment type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration.

3. Results Summary: Provide a detailed summary of participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and key conclusions.

4. Adverse Events Record: Document all observed adverse reactions or symptoms, and validate clinical statements related to individual CTRs or comparative analyses.

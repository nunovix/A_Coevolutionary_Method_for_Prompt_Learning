0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, encompassing four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments from different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS summarizing the participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs.

0->Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to confirm the accuracy of eligibility criteria, interventions, outcomes, and reported adverse events for individual or comparative analyses.
----------
1->Analyze the relationship between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and established clinical guidelines. CTRs detail trial methodologies and outcomes for evaluating new treatments' efficacy and safety, including diverse patient cohorts and interventions. CTRs are divided into four main parts: (1) Eligibility Criteria for Participants, (2) Treatment Protocols (type, dosage, frequency, duration), (3) Summary of Results (number of participants, outcome measures, units, conclusions), and (4) Documented Side Effects (symptoms observed during the trial). Provide expert insights that are data-driven, reflect the CTR content, and are in harmony with the report's conclusions.
----------
2->Review Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for accuracy in clinical relevance, evidence-based findings, and consistency. Focus on participant criteria, treatments given, results observed, and side effects noted.
----------
3->Analyze the relationship between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and established clinical guidelines. CTRs document trial methodologies and outcomes for evaluating new treatments' efficacy and safety, detailing patient demographics and interventions. Key sections include: (1) Eligibility Criteria for Participants, (2) Treatment Protocol (type, dosage, frequency, duration), (3) Summary of Results (number of participants, outcome measures, units, conclusions), and (4) Documented Side Effects (symptoms observed during the trial). Provide expert insights that are data-driven, consistent with CTR findings, and adhere to clinical standards.

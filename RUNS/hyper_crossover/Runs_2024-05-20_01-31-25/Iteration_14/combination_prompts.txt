0->Consider the problem of combining two different textual instructions, pertaining to the same task. The objective is to rephrase the main information common to the two descriptions, while keeping their meaning and intent. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The combined instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The combined instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instructions. Considering the aforementioned task description, combine the two textual instructions shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.
----------
1->"Compose a refined and comprehensive directive for professionals that integrates key components from two original instructions on the same subject. Ensure the directive captures the essence of the tasks, but articulate it with added clarity, definitions, or detailed explanations. The directive should be precise, straightforward, and improved in clarity to communicate the objective more efficiently than the originals."
----------
2->Re-formulate the following two expert-level textual instructions on the same task, synthesizing the core information while maintaining their original intent. Ensure the resulting instruction is either more succinct, encapsulating the key elements while preserving consistency with the initial purpose, or expanded with precise definitions and additional clarifications. Avoid penalizing for inaccuracies, but ensure clarity and directness in the instruction for better task execution.


INSTRUCTION 1: "Develop a comprehensive guide on optimizing machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis in financial markets."

INSTRUCTION 2: "Craft an in-depth tutorial on enhancing algorithmic trading strategies by leveraging advanced predictive analytics within the realm of finance."
----------
3->Craft a clear and detailed guideline for experts, merging essential elements from two task instructions, while keeping the central goal intact but simplifying or clarifying the process with added definitions and detailed explanations. Offer straightforward, unequivocal advice that enhances the original instructions' clarity.
----------
4->"Draft a polished and detailed directive for experts that synthesizes crucial elements from two distinct instructions on the same topic. The directive must encapsulate the core objectives of the originals while incorporating enhanced clarity, explicit definitions, or expanded explanations. The aim is to deliver a directive that is unequivocal, direct, and refined, surpassing the originals in effectively conveying the intended message."

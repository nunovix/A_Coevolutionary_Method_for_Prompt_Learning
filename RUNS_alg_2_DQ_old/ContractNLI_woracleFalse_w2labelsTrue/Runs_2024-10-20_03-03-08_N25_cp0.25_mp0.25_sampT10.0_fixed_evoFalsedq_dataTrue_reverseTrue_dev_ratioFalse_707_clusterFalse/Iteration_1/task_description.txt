0->You are tasked with identifying support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about these contents, and your task is to assess if these claims are supported or contradicted in the NDA.
----------
1->Evaluate semantic entailment between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements related to the confidentiality obligations they impose. NDAs govern the sharing and protection of sensitive data, outlining the scope of confidential information, obligations, agreement lifespan, and exclusions. Assess whether the claims made in a statement align with, or contradict, the information covered in a non-disclosure agreement.
----------
2->Your objective is to scrutinize semantic entailment relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements regarding the confidentiality obligations. NDAs specify conditions for handling sensitive information, including its definition, parties' obligations, agreement term, and exclusions. Carefully examine an input statement to determine if its claims about the NDA are substantiated by the descriptions in the agreement, or if they contradict it.
----------
3->Consider the challenge of assessing semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements. NDAs outline procedures and obligations for protecting confidential information, including its scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions. Evaluate whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions.
----------
4->Analyze a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to identify and articulate the semantic entailment relationships between specific clauses defining confidential information, the confidentiality obligations of the involved parties, the duration of these obligations, any exclusions from the confidentiality terms, and other relevant stipulations. Determine if a given assertion about the NDA's confidentiality provisions is substantiated or refuted by the document's content.

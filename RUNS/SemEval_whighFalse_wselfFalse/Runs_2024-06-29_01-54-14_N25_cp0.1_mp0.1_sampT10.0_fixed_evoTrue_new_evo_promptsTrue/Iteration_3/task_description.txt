0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Trials involve patient groups, called cohorts or arms, which may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. A complete CTR contains 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.

1->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
2->Analyze semantic entailment relationships between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts make are supported by CTR content. CTRs consist of four sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics and outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements should be related to CTR information, supported by CTRs, and not contradict the provided descriptions.



RESULTING INSTRUCTION:

"Analyze semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements, ensuring claims are supported by CTR data and do not contradict descriptions. CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient inclusion conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, outlining treatments administered to different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics and trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements should relate to CTR information, be supported by the reports, and not contradict the descriptions."

3->Evaluate semantic entailment connections between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements from clinical domain experts. CTRs provide comprehensive details about methodology and findings and methodologies of clinical trials assessmentioned in four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outcomes with conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatments, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics and trial outcomes, and (04) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements made by experts should claim to the CTR information, supported by the CTR, and not contradict the provided descriptions. The goal is to establish entailment between the statements and CTR sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.
----------
4->Analyze the semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical domain experts. CTRs, which detail of a clinical trial outcomes, assess new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Patient cohorts, cohorts different treatments or baseline characteristics. CTRs consist of four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient inclusion, dosage, frequency, and duration of interventions, (2) INTERVENTION, describing the trial, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant count, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (04) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements must be related to CTR sections, supported by CTR data, and non-contradictory.

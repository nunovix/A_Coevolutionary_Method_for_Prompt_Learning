0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

3->Your task is to evaluate the validity of clinical statements by examining specific components of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs provide detailed information about clinical trials, including the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. These reports are divided into four main sections: (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention, (3) Results, and (4) Adverse Events. Statements in CTRs make assertions about the data in these sections, either for a single report or for comparisons between multiple reports.

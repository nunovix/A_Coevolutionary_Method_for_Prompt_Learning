0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Your task is to analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by identifying and elucidating the supportive connections between individual sections and clinical statements. CTRs encapsulate trial methodologies and findings, evaluating new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Comprising four distinct sections, CTRs include: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines patient participation conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Clinical statements claim information from these sections for individual or comparative analysis of CTRs.

Examine Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) meticulously by pinpointing and explicating the interrelationships between discrete segments and clinical assertions. CTRs are structured into four principal components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, defining patient inclusion parameters, (2) INTERVENTION, specifying treatment particulars including type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment span, (3) RESULTS, encapsulating participant data, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and derived conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, registering any observed signs and symptoms. Analyze clinical statements for assertions pertaining to these components individually or in juxtaposition.

4->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements from clinical experts, assessing the efficacy and safety profiles of novel medical treatments. Analyze structured CTRs segmented into four key sections:

1. Eligibility Criteria for Trial Participants: Identify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participant selection.

2. Detailed Treatment Protocol: Specify the treatment type, dosage, frequency of administration, and the length of the trial.

3. Summary of Results: Provide a concise summary of the number of participants, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and derived conclusions.

4. Documentation of Adverse Effects: Catalog any symptoms reported by patients throughout the trial.

Ensure that expert statements are consistent with CTR data, corroborated by the reports, and correspond to the provided descriptions. Examine each section of the CTR meticulously for accurate entailment verification.

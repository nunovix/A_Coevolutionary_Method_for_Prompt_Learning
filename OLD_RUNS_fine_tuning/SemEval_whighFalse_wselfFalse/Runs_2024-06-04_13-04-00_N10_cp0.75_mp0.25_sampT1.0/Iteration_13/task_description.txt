0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

Conduct a comprehensive semantic analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), correlating therapeutic efficacy, safety profiles, patient demographics, and intervention specifics with established clinical knowledge. Critically evaluate eligibility criteria, detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration. Summarize trial outcomes, including participant numbers, outcome measures, units of measurement, and inferred conclusions. Document adverse events with observed signs and symptoms, substantiating all statements with data from CTRs, ensuring the integrity of the original content is preserved.

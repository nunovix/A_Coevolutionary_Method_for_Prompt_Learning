0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Consider the problem of assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements put forth by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements should be supported by the CTR information, not contradicting any of the provided descriptions. In brief, CTRs elucidate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, encompassing four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments from different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS summarizing the participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.

2->Determine the support for clinical statements by analyzing individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), which include eligibility criteria, intervention details, results summaries, and adverse event listings.
----------
3->Analyze individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to support clinical statements, ensuring that statements align with provided CTR information and do not contradict any descriptions.
----------
4->Analyze the methodology, findings, and key information in the four main sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs): Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events, to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of new treatments by determining the support of clinical statements.

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical specialists. CTRs detail the procedures and results of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. The assertions, conversely, make specific claims about information contained within sections of a single CTR or between two CTRs for comparative analysis. For entailment verification, ensure that the claim corresponds with the clinical trial data, is substantiated by the CTR, and does not conflict with the given descriptions.

2->Evaluate the semantic entailment between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical expert assertions, focusing on the efficacy and safety assessment of new treatments. Analyze CTRs structured into four sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Expert claims should align with CTR content, be substantiated by the reports, and remain consistent with provided descriptions. Special attention should be given to the specifics within each CTR section when verifying entailment.

3->Analyze the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and results of clinical trials aimed at evaluating new treatments' effectiveness and safety. These trials typically involve one to two patient cohorts with varying treatments or baseline characteristics. CTRs are structured into four distinct sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining patient conditions for trial participation, (2) INTERVENTION, describing the treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant count, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed patient signs and symptoms during the trial. Expert statements make claims about specific CTR sections, either for a single report or in comparative analyses between two. To confirm entailment, the statement's claim must correlate with the clinical trial data, be substantiated by the CTR, and not contradict the given descriptions.

4->

Perform a semantic entailment evaluation between particular segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical experts. Analyze CTRs, which contain comprehensive descriptions of clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of novel therapies, involving one to two patient groups with unique treatments or attributes. The CTRs are segmented into four parts: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, specifying patient conditions for trial inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and trial duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, recording observed patient symptoms during the trial. Clinical experts' statements relate to specific CTR sections or comparative analyses between two reports. Confirm entailment by ensuring the expert's claim is in line with the clinical trial data, substantiated by the CTR, and consistent with the provided descriptions.

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Systematically dissect Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) into four essential elements: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient inclusion requirements, (2) INTERVENTION, describing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Ensure accuracy and cross-verify statements related to these elements within a single CTR or across several CTRs.

2->

Analyze Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to identify associations between distinct sections and clinical assertions. CTRs record the procedures and results of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel medical interventions. Break down CTRs into four core components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outlining the inclusion criteria for trial subjects, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the intervention type, dosage, administration schedule, and duration of treatment, (3) RESULTS, providing information on participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and results, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any observed symptoms and side effects. Validate claims related to these components within a single CTR or across multiple CTRs.

Systematically dissect Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) into four essential elements: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient inclusion requirements, (2) INTERVENTION, describing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and treatment length, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and findings, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any noted signs and symptoms. Confirm and compare statements related to these elements within a single CTR or across several CTRs.

4->

Identify and elucidate the supportive associations between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical assertions. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and results of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Break down CTRs into four primary components: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines the prerequisites for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the nature, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and conclusions drawn, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, cataloging observed signs and symptoms. Analyze and substantiate claims made in relation to these segments, either pertaining to a single CTR or contrasting between two.

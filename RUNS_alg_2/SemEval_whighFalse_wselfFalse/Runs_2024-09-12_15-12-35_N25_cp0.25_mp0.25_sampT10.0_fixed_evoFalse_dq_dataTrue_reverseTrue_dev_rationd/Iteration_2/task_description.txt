0->Your objective is to evaluate whether clinical assertions are substantiated by the corresponding segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). These reports encapsulate the procedures and outcomes of clinical trials aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel medical interventions. CTRs are organized into four distinct parts: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines the criteria for patient eligibility, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the nature, dosage, frequency, and duration of the treatments administered, (3) RESULTS, summarizing the participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and the study's conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any unforeseen adverse reactions experienced by participants. Assessments may pertain to individual CTRs or comparative analyses between them.

1->Analyze the semantic entailment between clinical statements and the corresponding sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs document the methodology and results of clinical trials to evaluate new treatments

2->Examine the semantic entailment between clinical statements and the corresponding sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Clinical Trial Reports document the methodology and results of clinical trials to evaluate new treatments. Assess whether the statements issued by clinical domain experts accurately reflect the information contained within specific sections of CTRs. These statements may pertain to a single CTR or involve a comparative analysis of two CTRs. Validate the entailment by ensuring that the expert

3->Examine clinical statements for accuracy against Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) content, focusing on eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events.
----------
4->Your task is to critically assess the veracity of claims made about clinical trial findings by cross-referencing them with the detailed information provided in each segment of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs are systematically divided into four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which specifies who can and cannot participate in the trial, (2) INTERVENTION, which describes the nature, dosage, frequency, and duration of the treatment being tested, (3) RESULTS, which includes participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and the interpretations of the collected data, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, which documents any negative reactions or side effects encountered by participants. Scrutinize statements that claim to confirm or deny facts from these sections, whether they refer to a single CTR or compare findings across multiple reports.

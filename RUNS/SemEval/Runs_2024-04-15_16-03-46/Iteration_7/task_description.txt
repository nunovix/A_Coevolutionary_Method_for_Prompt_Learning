Determine semantic connections between statements made by clinical domain experts and corresponding sections in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs document clinical trials assessing the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial includes one to two patient cohorts with varying treatments or baseline characteristics. A CTR is structured into four key parts: (1) Eligibility Criteria, defining patient selection criteria, (2) Intervention, detailing treatment type, dose, frequency, and duration, (3) Results, reporting participant numbers, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) Adverse Events, recording reported symptoms during the trial. Statements represent assertions about information within one or more CTR sections. Assess entailment based on these relationships.

0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

2->:" You're an impressive AI agent, capable of tackling the challenging task of identifying semantic entailment relations. Let's focus on the intriguing world of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), where the effectiveness and safety of new treatments are assessed. In these reports, you'll encounter sections that outline the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA for patient participation, describe the INTERVENTION with its specifics, summarize the RESULTS, and list ADVERSE EVENTS. Each trial features 1-2 cohorts or arms, which may receive distinct treatments or have varying baseline characteristics. Your goal is to determine if statements made by clinical domain experts entail information from these CTR sections. These statements could relate to a single report or compare two reports, but they must be supported by the CTR information and not contradict the descriptions provided.

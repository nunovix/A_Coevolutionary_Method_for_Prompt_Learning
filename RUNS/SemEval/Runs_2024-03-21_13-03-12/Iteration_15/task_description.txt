2. INTERVENTION: Details treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration.
3. RESULTS: Provides participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions.
4. ADVERSE EVENTS: Reports observed signs and symptoms.

Clinical statements propose claims about the data within these CTR sections, either for an individual report or in comparative analyses. The claims must be supported by the CTR information and not contradict the provided descriptions.

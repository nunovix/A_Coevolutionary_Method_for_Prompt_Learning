0->To accomplish this task, you will need to analyze individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to determine the support for clinical statements. A CTR typically consists of four main sections: 

1. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: This section outlines the conditions under which patients participate in the clinical trial. 

2. INTERVENTION: This section describes the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of the treatments being tested. 

3. RESULTS: This section summarizes the key findings of the clinical trial, including participant information, outcome measures, units, and conclusions. 

4. ADVERSE EVENTS: This section lists any unexpected signs or symptoms that occurred during the clinical trial. 

Your task is to evaluate statements that make claims about the information in these sections, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two CTRs. You will need to carefully examine each section to determine the support for these statements.

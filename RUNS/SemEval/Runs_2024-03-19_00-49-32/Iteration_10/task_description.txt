Evaluate the semantic alignment of clinical domain expert statements with corresponding sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Assess the validity of statements by confirming their consistency with CTR data and sections, including eligibility criteria, intervention, results, and adverse events. Ensure statements are substantiated by clinical trial findings and do not contradict the CTR descriptions. Additionally, determine semantic entailment connections between individual CTR sections and clinical statements. Statements must be substantiated by clinical trial data, aligned with the CTR, and consistent with provided descriptions to establish a valid relationship. Each CTR includes sections on eligibility criteria, intervention, results, and adverse events, and may involve one or more patient cohorts or arms with potential differences in treatment types or baseline characteristics.

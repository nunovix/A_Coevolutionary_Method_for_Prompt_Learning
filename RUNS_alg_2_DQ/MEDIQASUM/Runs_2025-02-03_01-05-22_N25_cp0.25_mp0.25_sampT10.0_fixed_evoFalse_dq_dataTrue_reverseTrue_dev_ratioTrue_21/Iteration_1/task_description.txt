0->Consider the task of writing a clinical note summarizing a conversation between a doctor and patient. The note should be structured into 4 sections: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, PHYSICAL EXAM, RESULTS, ASSESSMENT AND PLAN. Be as accurate as possible in the summarization, attending to clinical concepts that are identified as present or absent in the transcription of the conversation.
----------
1->You are tasked with creating a clinical note from the transcription of a dialogue between a physician and a patient. Your summary should capture the essence of the conversation, organizing the information into sections. Begin by documenting the patient's main complaint and the relevant medical history. Next, present objective and measurable findings, followed by the doctor's assessment of the information given by the patient, and the corresponding diagnosis. Finally, present the strategy for medication management, and outline the follow-up plan for patient monitoring.

2->Your task concerns summarizing the transcript of a dialogue between a doctor and a patient, collected in the context of a clinical encounter. Start by briefly describing the main presenting issues, and then organize the relevant elements expressed in the conversation clearly and consistently. Be sure to describe the patient’s chief complaints, including onset, chronology, quality, and severity, taking as basis what the patient tells to the doctor about how he feels and what happened. Register also the measurable and objective facts about the patient’s status, such as vital signs or other findings, as observed by the doctor. Include the doctor's interpretation, in the form of complete list of diagnoses together with additional relevant attributes. Finally, document the treatment plan, including further investigations deemed necessary, referral procedures, new medications, or other prescribed therapies.

4->Create a clinical note by distilling the key points from a physician-patient conversation. Start by summarizing the patient's primary concern and their medical background. Then, outline the objective data collected and the doctor's interpretation of that data. The note should also include the doctor's assessment of the patient's symptoms and the resulting diagnosis. Finally, outline the treatment plan and schedule follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress.

5->Draft a medical note for an encounter between a healthcare provider and a patient. Attend to the most relevant information from a transcript of the conversation, identifying key clinical concepts such as medications, diseases, conditions, injuries, signs and symptoms. Structure the note according to standard formats, such as SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) or APSO (assessment, plan, subjective, objective). Be thorough, clear, and brief. You'll also be provided with an example note so you can know the structure we are looking for in the note.

The following example serves as a guideline to understand how to approach and solve the task of determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), providing an EXAMPLE CTR, an EXAMPLE STATEMENT, and an EXAMPLE ANSWER.
The information given next corresponds to an EXAMPLE CTR, an EXAMPLE STATEMENT, and an EXAMPLE ANSWER. Refer to this example to grasp the reasoning process associated to the task of determining the validity of clinical statements.
Attend to the next example as a demonstration for how semantic entailment should be assessed, noting that the provided example features parts corresponding to an EXAMPLE CTR, an EXAMPLE STATEMENT, and an EXAMPLE ANSWER.
Textual information corresponding to an EXAMPLE CTR, an EXAMPLE STATEMENT, and an EXAMPLE ANSWER is given next. Use this as a reference to understand the task and as a demonstration on how to determine the validity of clinical statements.

Answer YES, NO or NOT MENTIONED to the question of whether one can conclude the validity of the statement with basis on the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) information or if it is not present in the NDA.
----------
Indicate with either YES, NO or NOT MENTIONED whether it is possible to determine the validity of the statement based on the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). An answer of YES means that the statement is supported by the NDA, not contradicting the provided information. An answer of NO means that the statement is NOT supported by the NDA. An answer of NOT MENTIONED means that the content of the statement is not referred to in the NDA.
----------

Determine if the NDA supports the validation of a statement or remains silent on the issue.
----------


According to the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):

- If the statement matches or has no bearing on the shared information: Affirmative (Applicable to NDA-relevant or Independent of NDA-relevant information)
- If the statement opposes the disclosed information: Negative (Disagrees with NDA-revealed data)
----------

Indicate with either YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED whether the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) supports or contradicts the statement in question. A YES response signifies that the statement is consistent with the information in the NDA. A NO response indicates that the statement is not consistent with the NDA. A NOT MENTIONED response means that the statement's content is not mentioned or addressed in the NDA.
----------

Determine if the validity of a statement can be inferred from NDA information or if the NDA is silent on the matter.
----------

Based on the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), identify whether a given statement is:

1. Supported: The NDA contains information that confirms the statement.
2. Contradicted: The NDA explicitly states something that negates the statement.
3. Not Mentioned: The statement's content is not addressed in the NDA.
----------

Evaluate if the NDA permits the verification of a declaration or remains noncommittal on the matter.
----------


Under an NDA:

- For statements consistent or unrelated to shared information: Affirmative (Applicable or Independent)
- For statements contradicting disclosed information: Negative (Disagrees)
----------


Determine if the statement in question aligns or conflicts with the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) by responding with YES for consistency, NO for contradiction, or NOT MENTIONED if the statement is not addressed in the NDA.
----------

Determine if the NDA allows for the verification of statements or keeps neutral on the matter. Respond with "Supported" if the statement aligns with the NDA, "Not Supported" if it contradicts, or "Neutral" if the statement is not mentioned in the NDA.
----------

Determine if the statement aligns or conflicts with the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) by responding with YES for consistency, NO for contradiction, or NOT MENTIONED if the statement is not directly addressed in the NDA but may indirectly impact its validity.
----------


Under an NDA:

- Statements consistent or unrelated to disclosed information: Affirmative (Applicable or Independent)
- Statements contradicting or challenging disclosed information: Negative (Disagrees) or Not Mentioned (If not present in the NDA)
----------

Determine if the NDA provides information to support or refute the validity of a statement. If not, record as NOT MENTIONED.
----------


Indicate with YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED whether the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) supports or contradicts the validity of the statement. A YES response signifies that the statement is consistent with the NDA. A NO response indicates that the statement is not consistent with the NDA. A NOT MENTIONED response signifies that the statement's content is not mentioned in the NDA.
----------


Under an NDA, determine if the statement aligns (Affirmative) or contradicts (Negative) the disclosed information. For statements not addressed in the NDA, this should not be mentioned in the response.
----------

Indicate with either YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED whether the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) supports or refers to the validity of the stated information. A YES answer implies the statement is consistent with the NDA and supported by it. A NO answer means the statement contradicts or is not mentioned in the NDA. A NOT MENTIONED answer indicates the statement's content is not mentioned or addressed in the NDA.
----------

Determine if the NDA permits the verification of statements or remains neutral on this issue. A permissive response indicates that the NDA supports the verification of statements, while a neutral response signifies that the NDA does not explicitly address or forbid the verification of statements.
----------

Based on the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), determine if the statement is:

1. Supported: The NDA confirms the statement through explicit information.
2. Contradicted: The NDA negates the statement through explicit information.
3. Not Mentioned: The statement's content is neither confirmed nor negated by the NDA.
----------


According to the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):

- If the statement is consistent with or irrelevant to the shared information: Affirmative (Applicable to NDA-relevant or Independent of NDA-revealed data)
- If the statement contradicts the disclosed information: Negative (Disagrees with NDA-revealed data)
- The NDA may permit or remain noncommittal on the verification of a declaration. (Definitions and further clarifications on the term "verification" can be added as needed)
----------

Determine if NDA information permits the verification of statements or if the NDAs are neutral on the matter.
----------


Indicate with either YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED whether the statement in question is consistent or inconsistent with the information in the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). A YES response signifies that the statement is consistent with the NDA. A NO response indicates that the statement is not consistent with the NDA. A NOT MENTIONED response means that the statement's content is not mentioned or addressed in the NDA.
----------


Under an NDA:

- Statements consistent or unrelated to disclosed information: Affirmative (Applicable or Independent)
- Statements contradicting NDA information: Negative (Disagrees)
- Statements not mentioned in the NDA: NOT MENTIONED

This combined instruction retains the main information from both instructions, keeping the intent consistent. It is concise and clear, allowing experts to execute the task with a more streamlined understanding.
----------


Under an NDA, determine the consistency of statements with disclosed information:

- Affirmative: Applicable or Independent (supported or unrelated)
- Negative: Disagrees (contradicts)
- Not Mentioned: Statement's content is not explicitly referred to in the NDA.
----------

Under an NDA, indicate whether the statement in question is:

- Consistent or unrelated to disclosed information: Affirmative (Applicable or Independent)
- Contradictory to disclosed information: Negative (Disagrees)
- Not mentioned or addressed in the NDA: Not Applicable.

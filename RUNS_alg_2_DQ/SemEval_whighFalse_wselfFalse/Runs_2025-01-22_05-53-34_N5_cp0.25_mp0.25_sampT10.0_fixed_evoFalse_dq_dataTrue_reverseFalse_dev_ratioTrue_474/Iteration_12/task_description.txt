0->Consider the problem of assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements put forth by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements should be supported by the CTR information, not contradicting any of the provided descriptions. In brief, CTRs elucidate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, encompassing four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments from different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS summarizing the participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.

2->Assess the semantic entailment between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements must be grounded in the CTR information and not contradict any provided descriptions. Evaluate CTRs across four key sections: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either within a single CTR or between two CTRs.

3->Assess semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Evaluate CTR sections (ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS) for support of expert statements, ensuring no contradictions with provided descriptions.

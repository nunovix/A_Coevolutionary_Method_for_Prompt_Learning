0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims, focusing on patient eligibility, intervention details (type, dosage, frequency, and duration), detailed results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and adverse events (observed signs and symptoms). Ensure strict adherence to CTR content, evidence-based support, and explicit descriptions for an in-depth comparative evaluation. Emphasize methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

2->

Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical assertions, meticulously examining patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), comprehensive results (detailing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (noting observed signs and symptoms). Ensure methodological precision, evidence-based consistency, and strict adherence to provided descriptions for a thorough comparative assessment, with emphasis on methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

3->Conduct an exhaustive semantic entailment or support analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements, focusing on patient eligibility criteria, intervention details (type, dosage, frequency, duration), comprehensive results (participant counts, outcome measures, units, conclusions), and documented adverse events (observed signs and symptoms). Ensure methodological precision, evidence-based consistency, and strict adherence to provided descriptions for a thorough comparative assessment. Highlight methodology, outcomes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, meticulously examining patient eligibility criteria, intervention specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), detailed results (encompassing participant counts, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and documented adverse events (noting observed signs and symptoms). Ensure methodological rigor, evidence-based alignment, and strict compliance with the provided descriptions for an in-depth comparative evaluation, emphasizing methodology, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, specific interventions, results, adverse events, and conclusions.

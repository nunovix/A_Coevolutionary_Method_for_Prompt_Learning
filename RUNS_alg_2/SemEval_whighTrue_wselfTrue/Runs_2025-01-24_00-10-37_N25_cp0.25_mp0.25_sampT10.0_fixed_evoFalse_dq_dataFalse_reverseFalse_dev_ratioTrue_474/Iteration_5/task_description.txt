0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Consider the problem of assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements put forth by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, statements should be supported by the CTR information, not contradicting any of the provided descriptions. In brief, CTRs elucidate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, encompassing four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA specifying conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatments from different patient cohorts, (3) RESULTS summarizing the participant statistics and the trial outcomes, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.

CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION describing type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summarizing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms.

To establish entailment, statements should be supported by the CTR information, not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.
----------
4->Determine the support for clinical statements by analyzing individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs comprise four key components: 

1. Eligibility Criteria: outlines the conditions for patient participation. 
2. Intervention: describes the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments. 
3. Results: summarizes participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions. 
4. Adverse Events: lists unexpected signs and symptoms. 

When making claims about a single CTR or comparing two CTRs, ensure that statements are grounded in the CTR information and do not contradict any provided descriptions.

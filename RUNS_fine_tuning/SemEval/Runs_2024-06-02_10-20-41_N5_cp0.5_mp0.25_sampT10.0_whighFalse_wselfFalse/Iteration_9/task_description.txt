0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between distinct segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by specialists in the clinical field. CTRs detail the procedures and results of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. The assertions, conversely, make specific claims regarding information contained within sections of a single CTR or between two CTRs for comparative analysis. For entailment verification, ensure the claim is consistent with the clinical trial data, corroborated by the CTR, and does not conflict with the given descriptions.
----------
2->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis linking segments from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) with authoritative clinical statements. Thoroughly scrutinize methodologies, outcomes, treatments, inclusion/exclusion criteria, therapeutic interventions, results, and adverse reactions. Ensure expert statements are corroborated by CTR data, align with provided descriptions, and accurately reflect the content of a single CTR or in comparative analyses.

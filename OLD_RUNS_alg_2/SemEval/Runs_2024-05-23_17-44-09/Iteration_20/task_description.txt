0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

2->Analyze the semantic relationship between segments of Clinical Trial Reports and expert clinical declarations, emphasizing on the methodologies, results of the trials, and assessments of novel treatments. Confirm that experts' assertions regarding particular sections of CTRs are consistent with the trial data, agree with the CTRs' details, and are in harmony with the original context. Validate that these evaluations address the efficacy and safety of treatments in singular CTRs or when juxtaposed.
----------
3->Assess the semantic entailment between expert claims and precise extracts from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), verifying consistency with the given clinical data, validating substantial evidence within CTRs, and avoiding any content that contradicts the source material.

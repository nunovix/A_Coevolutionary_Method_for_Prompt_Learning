0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Evaluate semantic entailment connections between clinical statements derived from distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical domain experts. Establish entailment by ensuring statements are corroborated by CTR data and do not contradict the provided descriptions. CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA outlining conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS documenting unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements claim information from these sections, either for a single CTR or when comparing two CTRs.

2->Evaluate the semantic entailment relationships between clinical statements derived from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical domain experts. Assess the compatibility of expert statements with CTR data, ensuring no contradictions exist. Focus on the four sections of CTRs: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS, which document clinical trial methodologies and findings, assessing treatment efficacy and safety. Determine the support of clinical statements for a single CTR or across multiple CTRs.

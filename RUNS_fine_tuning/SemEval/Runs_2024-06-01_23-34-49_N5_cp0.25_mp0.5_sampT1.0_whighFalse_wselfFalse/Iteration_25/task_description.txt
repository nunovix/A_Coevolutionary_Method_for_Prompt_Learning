Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis to authenticate expert assertions by rigorously cross-referencing data from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Ensure unwavering compliance with the original descriptions. Thoroughly scrutinize CTRs detailing clinical trial protocols and outcomes to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of novel medical interventions. Verify that experts' claims are empirically backed by CTR data, accurately reflect the initial descriptions, and are consistent, non-contradictory, and corroborated across various CTRs.

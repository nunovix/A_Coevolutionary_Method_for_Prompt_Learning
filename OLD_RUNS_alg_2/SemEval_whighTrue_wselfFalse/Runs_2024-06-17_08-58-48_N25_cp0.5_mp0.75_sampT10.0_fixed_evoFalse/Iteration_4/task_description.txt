0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.

1->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
2->The objective is to examine semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements articulated by clinical domain experts. CTRs elaborate on the procedures and findings of clinical trials, scrutinizing the effectiveness and safety of novel treatments. Each trial involves cohorts or arms exposed to distinct treatments or exhibiting diverse baseline characteristics. Comprehensive CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA delineating conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION particulars specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary encompassing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS cataloging signs and symptoms observed. Statements posit claims regarding the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or in comparative analysis of two. To establish entailment, the statement's assertion should harmonize with clinical trial data, find substantiation in the CTR, and avoid contradiction with the provided descriptions.

"Analyze Clinical Trial Reports to determine semantic entailment with expert statements, covering Eligibility Criteria, Intervention details (type, dosage, frequency, duration), Summary of Results (participant count, outcome measures, units, conclusions), and Adverse Events documentation (observed signs and symptoms). Verify entailment by matching statements with CTR content, ensuring support and non-contradiction. Additionally, assess treatment effectiveness and safety by comparing expert claims across multiple CTRs for comparative insights."
----------
4->

"Analyze Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) to discern links between sections and medical claims. Thoroughly inspect each document's four main components: (1) PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS, outlining eligibility criteria for trial subjects, (2) TREATMENT PROCEDURES, detailing administered therapies, including dosage, frequency, and trial duration, (3) SUMMARY OF RESULTS, summarizing participant demographics, results metrics, units of measurement, and trial conclusions, and (4) SIDE EFFECTS RECORD, noting any observed side effects. Validate statements by cross-referencing with CTD data, document information, and provided descriptions. Additionally, assess treatment effectiveness and safety by comparing expert claims across multiple CTDs for a holistic understanding."

Determine semantic entailment relations between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements from clinical domain experts, focusing on eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Ensure the statements are related to, supported by, and non-contradictory to the respective CTR sections.

"Examine Clinical Trial Reports to establish semantic connections with expert assertions, encompassing (1) Eligibility Criteria, (2) Intervention specifics (including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), (3) Summary of Results (detailing participant numbers, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and (4) Adverse Events documentation (noting observed signs and symptoms). Confirm entailment by correlating statements with CTR content, ensuring they are supported and non-contradictory. Furthermore, evaluate treatment effectiveness and safety by juxtaposing expert claims across several CTRs to gain comparative insights."
----------
7->

Analyze Clinical Trial Documents (CTDs) by dissecting them into four critical segments: (1) PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS, specifying eligibility conditions, (2) TREATMENT DETAILS, detailing therapy specifics such as dosage, frequency, and trial duration, (3) FINDINGS SUMMARY, offering an overview of participant characteristics, results metrics, units of measurement, and trial conclusions, and (4) SIDE EFFECTS LOG, documenting any observed side effects. Validate statements by ensuring they are consistent with the CTD data, the document's content, and the provided descriptions.

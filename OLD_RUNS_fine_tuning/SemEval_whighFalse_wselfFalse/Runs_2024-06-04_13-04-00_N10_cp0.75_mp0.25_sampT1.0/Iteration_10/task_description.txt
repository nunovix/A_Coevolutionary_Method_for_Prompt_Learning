0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->

Execute a thorough semantic analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), correlating therapeutic effectiveness, safety, patient demographics, and intervention types with established clinical knowledge. Evaluate patient eligibility criteria, detailing treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration. Summarize trial outcomes, including participant numbers, outcome measures, units of measurement, and inferred conclusions. Document adverse events with observed signs and symptoms, substantiating all statements with data from CTRs and preserving the original content's integrity.

2->

Perform an exhaustive evaluation of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), aligning therapeutic effectiveness, safety parameters, participant demographics, and specifics of the interventions. Analyze the inclusion criteria for patient selection, elaborating on treatment specifics including type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration. Provide a summary of the trial results, capturing the number of participants, outcome measures, units of measurement, and inferred implications. Record any adverse events, detailing observed signs and symptoms, supported by data from the CTRs, ensuring the original content remains intact.

3->

Perform a detailed examination of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on discerning and explicating the interrelationships among individual sections and clinical assertions. CTRs encapsulate the methodologies and results of trials, assessing the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. Analyze the four key sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, describing the conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the specific treatment, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant data, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, noting any observed signs and symptoms. Ensure statements accurately mirror and juxtapose data across these sections or within a single CTR.
----------
4->

Perform an in-depth semantic analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to validate authoritative clinical claims regarding therapeutic efficacy and safety across varied patient demographics and interventions. This entails: (1) Evaluating eligibility criteria for participant selection, (2) Thoroughly examining treatment specifics, including type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) Analyzing outcome measures, encompassing participant count, indicators, units of measurement, and derived conclusions, and (4) Documenting adverse reactions by noting observed signs and symptoms. Ensure all assertions are substantiated with data from CTRs, preserving the integrity of the original information.

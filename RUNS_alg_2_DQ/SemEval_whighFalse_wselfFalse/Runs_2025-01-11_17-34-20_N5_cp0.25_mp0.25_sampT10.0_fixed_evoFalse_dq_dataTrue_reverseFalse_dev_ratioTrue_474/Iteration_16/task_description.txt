1-> Analyze individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to verify the accuracy of clinical statements regarding methodology, findings, and outcomes. When evaluating CTRs, you may need to compare information across multiple reports, making claims about the similarities and differences between them. This process involves examining the four key components of CTRs: eligibility criteria, intervention, results, and adverse events, to ensure consistency and accuracy in clinical statements.

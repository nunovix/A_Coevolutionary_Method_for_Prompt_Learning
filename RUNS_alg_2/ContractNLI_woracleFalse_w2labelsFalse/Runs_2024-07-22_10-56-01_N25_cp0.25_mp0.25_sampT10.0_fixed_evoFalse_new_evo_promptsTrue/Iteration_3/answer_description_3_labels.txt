0->Answer with YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED, to the question of whether one can conclude the validity of the statement with basis on the information from the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). An answer of NOT MENTIONED means that the information in the statement is not referenced in the NDA.
----------
1->You MUST respond with either YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED, to indicate whether it is possible to state that the statement is valid based on the information provided in the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). For the answer to be YES, the statement must be fully supported by the NDA. An answer of NOT MENTIONED means that the information in the statement is not referenced in the NDA.
----------
2->Indicate with YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED, whether the legal statement is valid. Answering NOT MENTIONED means that the statement is neither supported or contradicted by the NDA.
----------
3->"Evaluate the legal statement's validity in the context of the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). If the statement is directly supported by the NDA, respond with 'YES'. If the statement is directly contradicted by the NDA, respond with 'NO'. If the NDA neither supports nor contradicts the statement, respond with 'NOT MENTIONED'. This assessment should be based solely on the information provided within the NDA."

This combined instruction retains the essence of both original instructions, focusing on the evaluation of a legal statement's validity in relation to the NDA. It provides clear criteria for responding with 'YES', 'NO', or 'NOT MENTIONED', ensuring that experts can accurately determine the statement's standing based on the NDA alone.
----------
4->Determine if the assertion can be affirmed as true according to the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) contents. A confirmation requires full alignment with the NDA's stipulations. If the assertion lacks reference in the NDA, classify it as NOT MENTIONED.
----------
5->Evaluate the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to ascertain if it substantiates the statement's validity. Respond with YES, NO, or NOT MENTIONED accordingly.

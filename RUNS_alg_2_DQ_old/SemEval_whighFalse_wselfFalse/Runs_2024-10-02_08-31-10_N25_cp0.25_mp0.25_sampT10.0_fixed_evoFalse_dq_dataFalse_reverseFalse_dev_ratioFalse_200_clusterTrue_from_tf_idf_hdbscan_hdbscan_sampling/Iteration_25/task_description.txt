0->Examine the logical connections between statements made by medical experts and the contents of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Ensure that expert claims are substantiated by the CTRs, are consistent with the reported findings, and do not conflict with any of the details provided. CTRs document the methods and results of clinical trials, divided into four key areas: (1) PARTICIPANT CRITERIA outlining the qualifications for patient selection, (2) TREATMENT DETAILS describing the interventions applied to different groups of patients, (3) STATISTICAL RESULTS summarizing the data on participants and the efficacy of the trial, and (4) SIDE EFFECTS noting any adverse reactions observed. Assertions may pertain to a single CTR or draw comparisons between two CTRs.

End time: 2025-02-05 16:31:48.681100
Total elapsed time: 1 day, 16:14:07.817283
No. of iterations: 10
Average time per iteration: 4:01:24.781728

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 25
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 0
Max no. of iterations allowed: 200
Patience: 10
Evaluation done on: dev set
With 89 examples

Name of the model used: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
Retrieving examples-->False 
Alg 2 - Random sample 2 individuals weighted on scores, apply crossover and mutation to the offspring, top 0 performers are always kept as elite population
With crossover probability 0.5 and mutation probability 0.5

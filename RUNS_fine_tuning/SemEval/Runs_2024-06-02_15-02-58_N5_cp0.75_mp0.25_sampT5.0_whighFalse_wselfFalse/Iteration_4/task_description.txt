0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Evaluate the semantic entailment between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements, ensuring alignment with clinical trial data, substantiation within the CTR, and absence of contradictions to provided descriptions. The analysis should cover four CTR sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION specifics, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Clinical experts' statements must be consistent with these sections for individual or comparative CTR analyses.
----------
2->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis correlating expert assertions with explicit content from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), ensuring alignment with clinical trial data within ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections. Validate each expert claim against these sections for individual or comparative evaluations, ensuring no discrepancies with the original descriptions.
----------
3->

Perform a semantic entailment analysis of expert assertions in relation to the detailed segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Confirm that these assertions align with the clinical trial data. Validate that each claim is corroborated within the specified sections of the CTRs: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Execute this analysis for either singular or comparative evaluations, ensuring no contradictions arise with the given descriptions.
----------
4->

Conduct a semantic entailment analysis between expert assertions and detailed sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS for singular or comparative assessments. Ensure alignment with clinical trial data, corroboration within specified CTR sections, and consistency with given descriptions, avoiding contradictions.

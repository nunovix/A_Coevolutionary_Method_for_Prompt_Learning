0->Thoroughly scrutinize Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to ascertain the veracity of eligibility criteria, interventions, results, and adverse events. Confirm that expert commentary is semantically consistent with the CTR's documented methodology, outcomes, and safety profiles, ensuring there are no discrepancies.

1->Your task is to critically evaluate the validity of medical claims based on information extracted from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs are comprehensive documents that outline the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, focusing on the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. These reports are systematically organized into four main sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which specify the conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of the treatments administered, (3) RESULTS, summarizing the participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and the conclusions drawn from the data, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, which document any unexpected signs, symptoms, or adverse reactions observed during the trial. When evaluating expert statements, ensure that they accurately reflect the content of the CTRs, are substantiated by the data presented, and are consistent with the overall findings and conclusions of the report.

2->Examine Clinical Trial Reports meticulously to validate the accuracy of participant criteria, treatments, findings, and side effects. Ensure that expert analyses align with the trial's procedures, results, and safety data, with no inconsistencies.
----------
3->Conduct a thorough review of Clinical Trial Reports, scrutinizing participant eligibility, administered treatments, observed outcomes, and reported adverse effects. Confirm that expert evaluations are consistent with the methodologies, results, and safety information documented in the trials, eliminating any discrepancies.
----------
4->Carefully review Clinical Trial Reports to confirm that expert evaluations align with the trial's eligibility, interventions, outcomes, and safety data, ensuring accuracy in reflecting the trial's methodology and results.

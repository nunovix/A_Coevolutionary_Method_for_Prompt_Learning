----------
12->
Using the clinical trial report data, make a definitive YES or NO determination regarding the statement's validity. (Both instructions concur, hence no need for additional rephasing.)
----------
13->

Determine the agreement between the provided statement and the clinical trial report text. Interpret the medical jargon and context in each document, and clarify any ambiguities or lack of detail. Label as "Congruent" for alignment, "Incongruent" for opposition, or "Ambiguous" for uncertain relationship between the statement and clinical trial report text.
----------
14->

Assess the compatibility of the proposed hypothesis or condition with the clinical trial report data by deciphering any medical terminology and context from both sources. Clarify any ambiguities, data discrepancies, or uncertainties to maintain consistency between the stated hypothesis or condition and the clinical trial conclusions. Return a conclusive "YES" once a match is verified.
----------
15->
1. Compare the given statement and the clinical trial report to ensure consistency.
2. Interpret and clarify any discrepancies in medical terminology and context between the two.
3. Supply missing information and clarify ambiguities where necessary.
4. If the statement matches the clinical trial report, document "YES".
----------
16->

Determine the alignment of the given statement with the clinical trial report text. This requires interpreting the medical terminology and context in both documents and resolving any ambiguities or insufficient details. Classify the relationship as:

(A) Congruent: The statement agrees with the clinical trial report text.
(B) Incongruent: The statement contradicts the clinical trial report text.
(C) Ambiguous: The statement's meaning is unclear in relation to the clinical trial report text.

Assess the applicability of the given statement using the clinical trial report descriptions. This demands a comprehensive grasp of the medical terminology and context in both the report and the statement, as well as clarification of any ambiguities or missing details within the information provided.

Response: YES or NO. (For indicating whether the given statement can be evaluated using the clinical trial report descriptions)
----------
17->

Categorize the statement in relation to the clinical trial report as follows:

(A) Congruent: The statement aligns with the data in the clinical trial report.
(B) Incongruent: The statement contradicts the information in the clinical trial report.

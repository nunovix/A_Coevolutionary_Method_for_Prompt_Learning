0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->Assess the semantic alignment between expert declarations and qualification criteria, clinical protocols, outcomes, and side effects reported in Clinical Trial Documents, ensuring agreement, justified congruence, consistency, and non-contradiction for singular and comparative analyses.
----------
2->Assess the semantic entailment between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements, ensuring the following:

- Expert claims exactly mirror the content in designated sections of CTRs.

- Claims possess evidence within the CTRs, substantiating their validity.

- Ensure statements maintain coherence and are non-contradictory to CTR descriptions.
----------
3->Assess the semantic entailment between discrete segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. This entails:

1. Verifying that the expert claims correspond precisely with the content of specified CTR segments.

2. Ensuring that the claims have supporting evidence within the relevant CTRs, corroborating their legitimacy.

3. Guaranteeing coherence and avoidance of contradictions with the content of the CTR segments.
----------
4->Evaluate the semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical domain expert statements, ensuring alignment, support, and non-contradiction with clinical trial data, methodologies, outcomes, and provided descriptions.

0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two. When evaluating these statements, consider the methodology and data presented in each section to assess the validity and reliability of the claims.
----------
2->Your task is to evaluate the validity of clinical statements by examining specific parts of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs provide detailed information about clinical trials, including the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. These reports are divided into four main components: (1) eligibility criteria, (2) intervention details, (3) results summaries, and (4) adverse event listings. Statements in CTRs make assertions about the information in these sections, either for a single report or for comparisons between multiple reports.

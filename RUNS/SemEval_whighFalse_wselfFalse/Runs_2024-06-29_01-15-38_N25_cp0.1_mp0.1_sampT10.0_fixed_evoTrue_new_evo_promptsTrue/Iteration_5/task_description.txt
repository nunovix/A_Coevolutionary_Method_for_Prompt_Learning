0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Trials involve patient groups, called cohorts or arms, which may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. A complete CTR contains 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.

1->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

2->Assessentially analyze the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. CTRs provide details of clinical trial methodologies and outcomes, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel treatments. Statements assertions make claims about specific sections of CTRs of a single CTR or compare two CTRs. For entailment, ensure the statement's claim is consistent with the CTR' clinical entailment and does not contradict any descriptions.

3->Analyzeke the semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements from clinical domain experts. CTRs encaps detailing the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel treatments. Expert statements, however, make claims about specific sections of CTRs for a single CTR or comparative analysis of multiple reports. To validate entailment validation requires that the claim aligns with CTR information, with evidence from the CTR and no contradictions to the provided descriptions.

RESULTING INSTRUCTION:

Analyze the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements in the clinical domain experts. CTRs, which detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, evaluate the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Expert statements, on the other hand, make claims about specific sections of CTRs for a single CTR or comparative analysis of multiple reports. For entailment validation, ensure that the expert statement's claim aligns with the CTR information, is supported by evidence from the CTR, and does not contradict any of the provided descriptions.
----------
4->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.

0->Consider the task of writing a clinical note summarizing a conversation between a doctor and patient. The note should be structured into 4 sections: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, PHYSICAL EXAM, RESULTS, ASSESSMENT AND PLAN. Be as accurate as possible in the summarization, attending to clinical concepts that are identified as present or absent in the transcription of the conversation.
----------
1->Compose a healthcare note that encapsulates all the relevant information in a verbal exchange between a doctor and a patient. Adhere to standard recommendations for structuring clinical notes, considering parts such as the History of the Present Illness (HPI), a Review of Systems (ROS), conclusions from a Physical Examination (PE), lab and imaging results, and other relevant tests, and finally the doctor's Assessment and treatment Plan (A/P). As a way to aid you in the wrtiting of the note, you'll also be provided with an example note. Use it as a way to know the proper structure you should use.
----------
2->Craft a comprehensive clinical note based on a dialogue between a healthcare provider and a patient. Organize the note into four main sections: History of Present Illness (HPI), Review of Systems (ROS), Physical Examination (PE) findings, and Assessment and Treatment Plan (A/P). Ensure the note accurately reflects the patient's medical history, symptoms, examination results, and the healthcare provider's diagnosis and treatment strategy. Use the provided example note as a guide for the appropriate structure and format.
----------
3->Draft a medical note for an encounter between a healthcare provider and a patient. Attend to the most relevant information from a transcript of the conversation, identifying key clinical concepts such as medications, diseases, conditions, injuries, signs and symptoms. Structure the note according to standard formats, such as SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) or APSO (assessment, plan, subjective, objective). Be thorough, clear, and brief. You'll also be provided with an example note so you can know the structure we are looking for in the note.
----------
4->Compile a clinical note with sections on History of Present Illness, Physical Examination, Results, and Assessment and Plan, reflecting the dialogue's clinical details accurately.
----------
5->Compile a concise and comprehensive clinical note from a patient-doctor dialogue, capturing the essence of the encounter. Begin with the patient's chief complaints, detailing the symptoms' onset, duration, character, and intensity as narrated by the patient. Follow with objective findings, including vital signs and physical examination results. Summarize the doctor's assessment, listing all diagnoses with pertinent details. Conclude with the proposed treatment plan, outlining necessary tests, referrals, medications, or therapies. Format the note according to SOAP or APSO standards for clarity and brevity.

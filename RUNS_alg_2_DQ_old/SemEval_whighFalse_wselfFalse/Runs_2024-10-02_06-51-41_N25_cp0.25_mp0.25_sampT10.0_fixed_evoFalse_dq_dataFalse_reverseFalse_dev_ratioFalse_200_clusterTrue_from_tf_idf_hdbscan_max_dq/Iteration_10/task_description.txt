0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Assess the logical consistency between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and corresponding expert declarations. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and results of clinical trials, evaluating the effectiveness and safety of novel therapies. Expert declarations articulate assertions about particular CTR sections or compare two CTRs. To verify entailment, ensure the expert's assertion is corroborated by the CTR content and does not conflict with the CTR's narrative.
----------
2->Assess the logical consistency between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert opinions in the medical field. CTRs outline the procedures and results of medical studies, evaluating new therapies' effectiveness and safety. Conversely, expert opinions articulate assertions about particular CTR sections or compare two CTRs. To confirm logical consistency, the expert's assertion must be corroborated by the CTR data and not oppose any given details.
----------
3->Analyze the logical relationship between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert statements in the clinical field. CTRs outline trial methods and results, assessing new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Expert statements make assertions about specific CTR sections or compare two CTRs. Validate entailment by ensuring statements are supported by CTR data and do not conflict with the report's content.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->Conduct a semantic entailment analysis between expert assertions and explicit content from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on alignment with clinical trial data across ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections. Validate each expert claim for individual or comparative evaluations, ensuring consistency with the original descriptions and absence of contradictions.
----------
2->

Conduct a semantic entailment analysis correlating expert assertions with the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for singular or comparative assessments. Verify that these expert claims align with clinical trial data, are substantiated by corresponding CTR sections, and remain consistent with the initial descriptions, ensuring no contradictions arise.
----------
3->

Execute a semantic entailment analysis correlating expert statements with explicit content from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), verifying congruence with clinical trial data across ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections. Confirm the validity of each expert assertion within these sections for both individual and comparative assessments, ensuring strict adherence to the original content without introducing inconsistencies.

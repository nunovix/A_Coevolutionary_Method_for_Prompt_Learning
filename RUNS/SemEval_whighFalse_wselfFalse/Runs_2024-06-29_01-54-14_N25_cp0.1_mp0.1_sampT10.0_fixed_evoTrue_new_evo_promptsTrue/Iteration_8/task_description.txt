0->Evaluate semantic entailment connections between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements from clinical domain experts. CTRs provide comprehensive details about methodology and findings and methodologies of clinical trials assessmentioned in four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, outcomes with conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing treatments, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS, summarizing participant statistics and trial outcomes, and (04) ADVERSE EVENTS, listing observed signs and symptoms. Statements made by experts should claim to the CTR information, supported by the CTR, and not contradict the provided descriptions. The goal is to establish entailment between the statements and CTR sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two CTRs.

NEW INSTRUCTION: 04.1 Evaluate semantic entailment connections between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements, ensuring consistency with CTR sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA_1, (2) Intervention, CRITERIA_2, (3) Results, CRITERIA_3, and (4) Adverse Events, CRITERIA_4. Confirm expert claims are supported by CTR data, avoiding contradictions, and establish entailment for individual or comparative CTR analysis.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

Perform a semantic entailment analysis between expert statements and the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for singular or comparative evaluations. Ensure expert claims are in agreement with clinical trial data, corroborated by the respective CTR sections, and consistent with initial descriptions, avoiding any contradictions.

3->

Execute a semantic entailment analysis correlating expert assertions with the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) for singular or comparative assessments. Confirm that these expert claims are consistent with clinical trial data, substantiated by corresponding CTR sections, and align with the initial descriptions, avoiding any contradictions.
----------
4->Perform a semantic entailment analysis between expert assertions and explicit content from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), ensuring alignment with clinical trial data across ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION DETAILS, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections. Validate each expert claim for individual or comparative evaluations, confirming consistency with the original descriptions and avoidance of contradictions.

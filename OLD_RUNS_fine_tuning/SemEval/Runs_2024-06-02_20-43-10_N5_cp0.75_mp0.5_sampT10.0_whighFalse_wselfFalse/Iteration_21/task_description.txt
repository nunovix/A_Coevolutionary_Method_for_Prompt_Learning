0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.

1->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment and comparative evaluation between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical testimonials, focusing on methodologies, results, therapeutic effectiveness, and safety assessments. Rigorously follow clinical guidelines, employ exact medical jargon, and guarantee semantic alignment with expert testimonies. Confirm this alignment through cross-verification of CTR data, corroboration with pertinent CTRs, and synchronization of detailed sections or comparative analyses with expert-provided information.
----------
2->

Perform a semantic entailment evaluation between distinct parts of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical claims. Scrutinize CTRs detailing clinical trial procedures and outcomes, with emphasis on evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Analyze authoritative clinical statements for assertions pertaining to specific segments of CTRs, applicable to individual or comparative analyses involving multiple CTRs. Confirm entailment by verifying that claims align with clinical trial data, are substantiated by CTR information, and do not conflict with the provided descriptions.
----------
3->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment and comparative evaluation between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical testimonials, focusing on data interpretation, research methodologies, results, therapeutic effectiveness, and safety assessments. Uphold rigorous adherence to clinical guidelines, employ precise medical jargon, and ensure semantic congruence with expert testimonies. Validate this congruence by meticulously cross-referencing CTR data, confirming with pertinent CTRs, and accurately aligning specific sections or comparative analyses with expert insights.

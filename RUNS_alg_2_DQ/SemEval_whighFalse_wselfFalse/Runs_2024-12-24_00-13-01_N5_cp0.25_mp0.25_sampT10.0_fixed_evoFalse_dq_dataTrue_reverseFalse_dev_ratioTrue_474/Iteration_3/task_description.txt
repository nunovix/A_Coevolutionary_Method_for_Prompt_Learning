0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts, focusing on the alignment of claim statements with the methodology and outcomes described in CTRs. This entails verifying that the statement's claim is supported by the CTR information and does not contradict any of the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts, focusing on the alignment of claim statements with the methodology, outcomes, and supporting evidence described in CTRs. Verify that the statement's claim is supported by the CTR information, consistent with the methodology and outcomes, and does not contradict any of the provided descriptions.
----------
2-> Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, (2) INTERVENTION, (3) RESULTS, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two, and should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any descriptions.
----------
3->Evaluate claim statements issued by clinical experts against the methodology and outcomes described in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on alignment between claim statements and CTR sections (ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS).
----------
4->Assess the consistency of clinical expert statements with the corresponding sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs are divided into four parts: Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. Experts make assertions about the information in these sections, either for a single report or when comparing two, and their claims should be grounded in the report's content and not contradict any descriptions.

5->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts, focusing on the alignment of claim statements with the methodology and outcomes described in CTRs. Verify that the statement's claim is supported by the CTR information and does not contradict any of the provided descriptions.

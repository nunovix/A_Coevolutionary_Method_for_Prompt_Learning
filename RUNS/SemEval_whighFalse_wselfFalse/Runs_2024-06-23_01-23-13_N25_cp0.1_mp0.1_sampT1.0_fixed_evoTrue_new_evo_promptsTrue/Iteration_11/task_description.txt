0->Assess the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert clinical statements. Analyze CTRs to evaluate clinical trial methodologies and outcomes, focusing on treatment efficacy and safety. CTRs are divided into four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment specifics, (3) RESULTS summarizing participant data, outcome measures, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS documenting observed signs and symptoms. Expert statements claim information within these CTR sections for individual reports or comparative analyses. Validate entailment by ensuring statements align with CTR content, are supported by the reports, and do not contradict provided descriptions.

3->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

0->Consider the task of determining semantic entailment relations between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements made by clinical domain experts. Note that CTRs outline the methodology and findings of a clinical trial, which are conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Each trial involves 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms, and these groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. The complete CTRs contain 4 sections, corresponding to (1) a list of the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA corresponding to the conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial, (2) a description for the INTERVENTION that specifies the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied, (3) a summary of the RESULTS, detailing aspects such as the number of participants in the trial, the outcome measures, the units, and the conclusions, and (4) a list of ADVERSE EVENTS corresponding to signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial. In turn, the statements are sentences that make some type of claim about the information contained in one of the aforementioned sections, either considering a single CTR or comparing two CTRs. In order for the entailment relationship to be established, the claim in the statement should be related to the clinical trial information, it should be supported by the CTR, and it must not contradict the provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert claims, focusing on methodologies, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, conclusions, and adverse event documentation. Ensure that expert statements are clinically relevant, substantiated by CTRs, and strictly conform to the detailed standards of individual or comparative CTR evaluations.
----------
2->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert assertions, scrutinizing methodologies, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, conclusions, and adverse event records. Verify that expert claims are clinically pertinent, grounded in evidence from CTRs, and adhere to stringent standards for individual or comparative CTR assessments.

3->

Analyze the semantic entailment relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and claims made by clinical experts. Recognize that CTRs document the methodology and results of clinical trials aimed at evaluating new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Each trial comprises 1-2 patient groups, known as cohorts or arms, receiving varied treatments or possessing distinct baseline characteristics. CTRs consist of four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION detailing treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS summarizing trial participant count, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing observed patient signs and symptoms during the trial. Statements made by clinical experts are claims about information within these sections of a single CTR or comparisons between two CTRs. Establish entailment by ensuring the claim is related to the CTR content, supported by the CTR, and non-contradictory to the descriptions.
----------
4->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert assertions, meticulously examining methodologies, results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, conclusions, and adverse event documentation. Confirm that expert claims are clinically relevant, substantiated by data from CTRs, and comply rigorously with the precise specifications for individual or comparative analysis of CTRs.

0->Consider the problem of combining two different textual instructions, pertaining to the same task. The objective is to rephrase the main information common to the two descriptions, while keeping their meaning and intent. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The combined instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The combined instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instructions. Considering the aforementioned task description, combine the two textual instructions shown next in quotes, generating only the resulting instruction without any additional explanation.
----------
1->Integrate and rephrase the key elements from the following two instructions regarding the same task, ensuring the central objective is preserved for an expert audience. Create a directive that either succinctly summarizes the main points, maintaining consistency with the original intent, or further clarifies by including definitions and additional details. The directive should be explicit, direct, and more instructive than the originals, without any misinformation.
----------
2->Rephrase and integrate the essential elements from two separate instructions concerning the same task, ensuring the core purpose remains intact for an expert audience. Formulate a directive that succinctly encapsulates the primary information or, alternatively, enhances clarity with additional explanations and definitions. Strive for explicit, direct instructions that surpass the original instructions' clarity in conveying the task.

4->Transform and consolidate the fundamental details from two separate textual instructions that pertain to the same subject, ensuring the retention of their core intent and objective. This revised guideline should be designed for an expert audience, possibly serving as a brief synopsis or an elaborate, comprehensive version of the instructions, free from errors. Aim for clarity and straightforwardness in describing how to perform the task, surpassing the original instructions in informative quality.

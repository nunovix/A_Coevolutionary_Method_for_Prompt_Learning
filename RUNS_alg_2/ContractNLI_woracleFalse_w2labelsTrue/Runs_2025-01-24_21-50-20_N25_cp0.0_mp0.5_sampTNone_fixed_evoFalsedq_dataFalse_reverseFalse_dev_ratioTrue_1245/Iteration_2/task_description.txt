0->Your objective is to scrutinize semantic entailment relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements regarding the confidentiality obligations. NDAs specify conditions for handling sensitive information, including its definition, parties' obligations, agreement term, and exclusions. Carefully examine an input statement to determine if its claims about the NDA are substantiated by the descriptions in the agreement, or if they contradict it.
----------
1->Analyze statements about Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) to determine if they accurately reflect supported confidentiality obligations, using the NDA's framework to verify claims about sensitive information, exclusions, and usage obligations.
----------
2->Consider the challenge of assessing semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements. NDAs outline procedures and obligations for protecting confidential information, including its scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions. Evaluate whether the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions.
----------
3->Analyze the semantic entailment relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements regarding confidentiality obligations. Examine the NDA's definitions, parties' obligations, agreement term, and exclusions to verify if input statements substantiate or contradict these elements, ensuring alignment with the agreement's conditions.

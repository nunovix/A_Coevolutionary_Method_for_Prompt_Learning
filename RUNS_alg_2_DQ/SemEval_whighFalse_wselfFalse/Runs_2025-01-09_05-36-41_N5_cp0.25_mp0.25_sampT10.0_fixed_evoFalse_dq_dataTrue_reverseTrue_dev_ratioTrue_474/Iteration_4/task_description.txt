0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

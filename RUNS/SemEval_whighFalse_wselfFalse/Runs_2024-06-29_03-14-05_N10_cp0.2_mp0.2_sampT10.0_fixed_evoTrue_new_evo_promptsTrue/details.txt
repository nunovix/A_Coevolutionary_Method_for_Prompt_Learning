Total elapsed time: 0:28:11.374164
No. of iterations: 30
Average time per iteration: 0:00:56.379139

Initial population size (size of suprompts pop): 10
How many of the top performers are being kept(elite): 0
Max no. of iterations allowed: 30
Patience: 10
Evaluation done on: dev set
With 20 examples

Name of the model used: unsloth/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct 
4 bit quantization: True 
Now the individuals are not bonded, meaning that new subprompts are created and randomly combined 
Retrieving examples-->False 
Alg 2 - Random sample 2 individuals weighted on scores, apply crossover and mutation to the offspring, top 0 performers are always kept as elite population
With crossover probability 0.2 and mutation probability 0.2

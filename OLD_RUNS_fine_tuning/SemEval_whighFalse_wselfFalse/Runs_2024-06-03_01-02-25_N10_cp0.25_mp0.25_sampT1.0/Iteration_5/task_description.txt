0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->Assess the semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical experts. Analyze CTRs detailing clinical trial methodologies and results, focusing on treatment effectiveness and safety. Compare expert statements, which claim specific information from a single CTR or between two CTRs, ensuring alignment with clinical trial data, CTR support, and absence of contradictions to the given descriptions.

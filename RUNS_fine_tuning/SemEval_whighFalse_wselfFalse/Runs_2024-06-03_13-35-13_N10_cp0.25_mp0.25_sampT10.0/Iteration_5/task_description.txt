0->Determine the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-issued statements, focusing on methodology, outcomes, efficacy, and safety of new treatments. Analyze the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION details, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS sections of CTRs. Ensure that expert statements align with, support, and do not contradict the information within these sections for a single CTR or in comparative analyses between two CTRs.
----------
1->Assess the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-issued statements, focusing on the methodology, outcomes, efficacy, and safety of clinical trials. Evaluate statements for alignment with CTR sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, detailing patient participation conditions, (2) INTERVENTION, specifying treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, outlining participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting observed signs and symptoms. Ensure statements support CTR information, find backing within the CTR, and do not contradict the descriptions.
----------
2->Examine the semantic entailment between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements from clinical experts, concentrating on methodology, outcomes, treatment efficacy, and safety. Analyze ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION specifics, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS within CTRs. Ensure expert statements are consistent with, corroborate, and avoid contradicting the information in these CTR sections for individual or comparative analyses.
----------
3->Evaluate the semantic correspondence between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative expert declarations, emphasizing methodology, outcomes, treatment efficacy, and safety. Scrutinize the ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION specifics, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS in CTRs. Verify that expert commentary is congruent, corroborative, and non-contradictory to the data in these CTR segments, either within a single report or across multiple comparative analyses.
----------
4->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

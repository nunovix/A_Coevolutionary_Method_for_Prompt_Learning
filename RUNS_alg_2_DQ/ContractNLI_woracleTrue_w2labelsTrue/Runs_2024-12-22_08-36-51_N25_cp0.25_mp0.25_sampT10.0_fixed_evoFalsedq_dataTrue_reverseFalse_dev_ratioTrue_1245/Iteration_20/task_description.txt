0->Consider the challenge of assessing semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements. NDAs outline procedures and obligations for protecting confidential information, including its scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions.

----------
1->Analyze the logical relationships between statements made about Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and the actual terms of the agreement, focusing on key aspects such as scope, obligations, duration, and exclusions. This involves examining how the agreement's provisions support or contradict the statements, and determining the overall consistency between the two.

2->Assess the semantic entailment between distinct sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and related statements to determine the extent to which the statements' assertions about the NDA are supported or contradicted by the agreement's descriptions. Specifically, examine the scope, usage obligations, duration of protection, and exclusions outlined in the NDA to evaluate the logical connections between the statements and the agreement's provisions.

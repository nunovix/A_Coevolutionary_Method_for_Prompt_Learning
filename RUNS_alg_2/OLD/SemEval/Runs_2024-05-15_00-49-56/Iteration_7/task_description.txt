0->Your task is determining support relationships between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing signs and symptoms observed. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Determine clinical relationships by analyzing Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on Eligibility Criteria, Intervention specifics, Results, and Adverse Events, to generate assertions or comparative analysis for expert scrutiny.
----------
2->Determine the support relationships between sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and clinical statements. Analyze CTRs, which comprise eligibility criteria, intervention description, results summary, and adverse events listing, to assess new treatments' effectiveness and safety. Compare and relate statements to specific sections, considering a single CTR or between two.
----------
3->Determine the supportive associations between Clinical Trial Report segments and clinical assertions, focusing on the following key elements: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. For experts, analyze and contrast clinical statements based on the detailed aspects of CTRs, encompassing patient eligibility, treatment specifics, outcomes, and observed adverse effects.
----------
4->Produce detailed Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) by systematically evaluating and correlating eligibility requirements, therapeutic interventions, outcome metrics, and side effects. Extract and compile accurate clinical findings from individual CTR elements, or integrate information across various studies. Cultivate expertise in clinical jargon, investigative techniques, and the significance of trial results.

0->Consider how to combine two separate textual instructions for the same task. The primary objective is to rephrase the main information that is common to both descriptions, using different words and changing the ordering of the statements, while ensuring that their meaning and intent remain intact. It is important to include all relevant details from both instructions, regardless of whether this makes the final instruction longer. The resulting instruction should be clear, comprehensive, and informative, providing a thorough guide for task execution. This means paying attention to nuances and specific details in both texts, integrating them seamlessly to produce a unified directive that leaves no room for ambiguity. The final instruction should be detailed enough to cater to experts in the field, ensuring they have all the information needed to perform the task efficiently.
----------
1->You are tasked with merging two different instructions that aim at the same objective. You should rephrase the core information that is common to both descriptions, taking the best ideas from each and building upon them to enhance clarity (e.g., by replacing words, deleting irrelevant parts, or changing the ordering of the statements). You have the freedom to add further explanations and clarifications where necessary, as long as the final instruction remains clear, comprehensive, easy to follow, and true to the original intent. The goal is to create a combined instruction that not only preserves the essential information from both descriptions, but also improves upon it, making it easier for experts in the field to execute the task accurately and efficiently.
----------
2->Combine the key points from the two provided textual descriptions into a single, coherent instruction. Ensure that the essence and objectives of the original instructions are maintained. Present the consolidated instruction in a clear, concise, and expert-friendly manner.
----------
3->Synthesize the essential elements from both provided directions, ensuring a clear, concise, and comprehensive guide for experts to execute the task with confidence and precision. Incorporate the most effective ideas, refine the language for improved clarity, and maintain fidelity to the original objectives. Enhance the instruction with necessary definitions and clarifications to facilitate accurate and efficient task completion.
----------
4->Synthesize the objectives from both original directives, extracting and refining the key elements to form a singular, streamlined directive. Ensure the new instruction maintains fidelity to the original intents while enhancing readability and comprehension for specialists.
----------
5->Combine the core objectives from the initial directives, refining the language for improved clarity. Merge the best practices from each, crafting a directive that is comprehensive, precise, and enables field experts to carry out the task with accuracy and efficiency.
----------
6->Synthesize the key elements from the provided textual descriptions into a single, refined directive. Ensure the rephrased instruction captures the essence of the original objectives, maintains accuracy, and is tailored for expert comprehension. Enhance clarity by eliminating redundancies.
----------
7->Craft an expert-level, succinct, and all-encompassing directive that captures the crux of the initial instructions. Integrate superior concepts, streamline the prose for enhanced lucidity, and preserve the integrity of the intended goals. Amplify the guidance with requisite elucidations and expansions to ensure precise and expedient task fulfillment.

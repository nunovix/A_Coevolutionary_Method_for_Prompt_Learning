0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Your objective is to evaluate whether clinical statements accurately reflect the content of specific sections within Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs provide a comprehensive overview of clinical trials, including their methodology, results, and implications for treatment efficacy and safety. These reports are organized into four distinct sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participant selection, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the intervention
----------
2->Assess if clinical summaries correctly represent the information in designated segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs offer detailed accounts of clinical trials, encompassing methodology, findings, and their impact on treatment effectiveness and safety. The reports are segmented into four key areas: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which specifies the criteria for selecting participants, (2) INTERVENTION, which describes the treatment administered.

0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment evaluation between expert clinical statements and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Validate that expert claims are corroborated by CTRs, ensuring there are no contradictions. Align expert assertions with CTRs' sections on Eligibility Criteria, Intervention details, Results, and Adverse Events. Confirm consistency in both individual and comparative analyses across multiple CTRs.
----------
2->

Perform a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis correlating expert clinical claims with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), ensuring expert assertions are corroborated by CTRs, free from contradictions. Align expert statements with CTR sections on Eligibility Criteria, Intervention specifics, Results, and Adverse Events. Confirm consistency for individual and comparative analyses across multiple CTRs.
----------
3->

Execute a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between expert clinical claims and Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), verifying that expert assertions are corroborated by the CTRs without contradictions. Align expert statements with corresponding CTR sections on Eligibility Criteria (patient inclusion conditions), Intervention specifics (treatment details including type, dosage, frequency, and duration), Results (participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions), and Adverse Events (observed signs and symptoms). Ensure consistency for both individual and comparative analyses across CTRs.
----------
4->

Conduct an in-depth semantic entailment analysis correlating expert clinical assertions with Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), verifying that expert claims are substantiated and non-contradictory with respect to CTRs. Align these expert claims with corresponding sections in CTRs pertaining to Eligibility Criteria, Intervention specifics, Results, and Adverse Events. Ensure consistency is maintained for both singular and comparative analights across a diverse range of CTRs.

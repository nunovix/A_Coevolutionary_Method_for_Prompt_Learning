Align clinical experts' assessments with corresponding sections in Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). Reconcile any inconsistencies between professionals' evaluations and CTR data to ensure uniformity. CTRs are indispensable tools, offering in-depth knowledge on clinical study protocols, outcomes, and safety and efficacy details. Essential elements of CTRs encompass:

1. Eligibility: Well-defined inclusion criteria
2. Procedure: Detailed intervention descriptions, including dosages, techniques, and durations
3. Evaluation: Extensive demographic information, diagnostic procedures, and trial results
4. Adverse Effects: Thorough documentation of adverse event occurrences, symptoms, and severity

Clinical experts may scrutinize individual CTRs or multiple reports for comprehensive evaluations.

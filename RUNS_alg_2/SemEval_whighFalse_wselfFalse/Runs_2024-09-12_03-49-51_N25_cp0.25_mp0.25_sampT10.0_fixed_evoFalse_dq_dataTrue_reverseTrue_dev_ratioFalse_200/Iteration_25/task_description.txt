0->Evaluate the credibility of health-related claims from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Critically analyze the four essential sections of a CTR: (1) Participant Inclusion Criteria, (2) Treatment Details, including type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Participant Outcomes, summarizing demographics, results, measurements, and observations, and (4) Recorded Adverse Events, noting any negative reactions. Use data from a single Clinical Trial Report or compare two to ensure a comprehensive and unambiguous assessment for medical professionals.

1->Critically evaluate the credibility of health-related claims from Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), focusing on the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Thoroughly analyze the four key sections of a CTR: (1) Participant Selection Criteria, (2) Treatment Regimen, detailing type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) Participant Outcomes, summarizing demographics, results, measurements, and observations, and (4) Recorded Adverse Events, noting any negative reactions. Compare data from multiple CTRs to ensure a comprehensive and unambiguous assessment for medical professionals.
----------
2->Perform an in-depth analysis of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of new medical therapies. Focus on: (1) Participant selection criteria, (2) Treatment protocol specifics, (3) Observed participant outcomes, and (4) Recorded adverse events. Compile a comprehensive report for healthcare professionals.
----------
3->Conduct a thorough examination of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to assess the efficacy and safety of emerging medical treatments. Your analysis should meticulously cover: (1) the criteria used for selecting participants, (2) the specifics of the treatment protocols applied, (3) the outcomes observed in participants during the trial, and (4) any adverse events that were documented. Synthesize your findings into a detailed report aimed at informing healthcare professionals.

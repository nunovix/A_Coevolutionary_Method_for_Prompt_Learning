0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.
----------
1->Evaluate the validity of clinical assertions derived from individual segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs encapsulate the protocols and outcomes of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of novel therapies. These reports are divided into four distinct parts: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which outlines the criteria for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION, detailing the treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, summarizing the participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and final conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, documenting any unforeseen adverse reactions. Assertions may pertain to a singular CTR or contrast findings between two.

2->Assess the accuracy of clinical claims based on individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs provide a comprehensive overview of clinical trials, focusing on the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. These reports are segmented into four key areas: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, which specifies the inclusion criteria for patients, (2) INTERVENTION, which describes the treatment specifics such as type, dosage, frequency, and duration, (3) RESULTS, which includes participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS, which records any unexpected adverse reactions. Evaluate these claims individually or compare results from different CTRs.

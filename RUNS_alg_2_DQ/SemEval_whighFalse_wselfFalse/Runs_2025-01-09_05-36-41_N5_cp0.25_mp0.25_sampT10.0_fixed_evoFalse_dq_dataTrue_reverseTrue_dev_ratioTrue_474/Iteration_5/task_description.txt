0->Your task is determining the support of clinical statements from individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). CTRs detail the methodology and findings of clinical trials, assessing effectiveness and safety of new treatments. CTRs consist of 4 sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA listing conditions for patient participation, (2) INTERVENTION description specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary detailing participants, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS listing unexpected signs and symptoms. Statements make claims about information in these sections, either for a single CTR or comparing two.

1->Analyze individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) to determine support for clinical statements. A CTR consists of four main sections: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, and ADVERSE EVENTS. Evaluate statements making claims about the information in these sections, either for a single CTR or for comparisons between two CTRs. Assess the methodology and findings of clinical trials, evaluating effectiveness and safety of new treatments. Pay close attention to nuances and specific details in these sections, integrating them to provide a thorough guide for task execution.

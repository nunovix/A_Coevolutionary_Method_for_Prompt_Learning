task_description: ['Consider the problem of rewriting a textual instruction, in which the objective is to rephrase the descriptions by changing the phrasing or the ordering of the explanations, while keeping the exact same meaning. Assume that the audience for the resulting instruction consists of experts in the field. The rewritten instruction can either be shorter, summarizing the main points while keeping consistency with the original intent, or it can be made longer, by adding definitions and further clarifications. You will be penalized for the inclusion of incorrect information. The re-written instruction should be concise and direct, and it should inform the execution of the task in a clearer way than the original instruction.', 'Consider the problem of rephrasing a textual instruction, where the main objective is to rewrite the descriptions accurately. Focus on making the new instruction more concise, but it is crucial to retain the core information and essence of the original instruction. The end result should be a clear and direct rephrasing that maintains the intended meaning, without any loss of important details. The rephrased instruction should be easily comprehensible by experts in the field, ensuring no ambiguity or misinterpretation.', 'Reflect on the task of paraphrasing a written instruction, where the goal is to modify the expalnations by reordering or replacing words and phrases, while keeping the same overall meaning. Focus on generating a new instruction that, while being lexically distinct, remains simple, understandable, and clear.', 'You are tasked with modifying an input textual instruction, by changing the ordering and the level of detail in the associated explanations. The goal is to create a new instruction that not only preserves the essential information, but that also improves upon it, making it easier for experts in the field to execute the task accurately and efficiently.', 'Think about the task of modifying a written instruction, with a focus on improving the performance of AI systems when executing the task. You should rephrase the instruction by changing the wording and the ordering of the commands, ensuring that the new version enhances the clarity and effectiveness of the descriptions. Attend to the nuances of the original instruction, and make sure that the rewritten version is precise, actionable, and free of ambiguities, thereby facilitating a seamless execution of the task.']

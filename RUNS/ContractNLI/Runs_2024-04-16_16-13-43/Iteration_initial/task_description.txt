0->Consider the task of establishing semantic entailment relations between parts of a Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and assertions about the agreement's confidentiality obligations. NDAs outline the terms for sharing and protecting sensitive information, detailing aspects such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the parties, duration of the agreement, exclusions, and other pertinent terms. The goal is to determine whether statements regarding the NDA content are supported by the text or contradict it.
----------
1->Your task involves identifying support relationships between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements concerning confidentiality obligations. NDAs detail the framework for the exchange and protection of sensitive information, including what is considered confidential, usage obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, etc. Statements make claims about this content, and your role is to assess if these claims are supported or contradicted in the NDA.
----------
2->Evaluate the semantic entailment between sections of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and statements related to the confidentiality obligations they impose. NDAs govern the sharing and protection of sensitive data, outlining the scope of confidential information, obligations, agreement lifespan, and exclusions.

2. Usage obligations
3. Protection duration
4. Exclusions

Determine if the statements:
a) Are in agreement with the NDA terms
b) Are contradictory to the NDA terms
c) Have no bearing on the NDA provisions.
----------
7->
Establish semantic entailment relationships between NDA text and confidentiality obligation statements. Analyze NDAs for components such as confidential information definition, parties' obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, and other crucial terms. Determine if given statements align with or contradict the NDA text.
----------
8->

9->
Identify support relationships between NDA sections and statements about confidentiality obligations. Evaluate if statements are consistent or contradictory to NDA details regarding confidential information, usage, duration, and exclusions.
----------
10->
Analyze the given Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and corresponding statements to determine if there are any support relationships or contradictions. Evaluate the NDAs for their confidential information definitions, usage obligations, agreement durations, exclusions, and other relevant details. Assess each statement against this information to determine if it is supported or contradicted.
----------
11->
1. Analyze the compatibility of statements with the semantics of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) in terms of confidentiality obligations.
2. Identify the components of NDAs, including the scope of confidential information, obligations, agreement duration, and exclusions.
3. Compare the statements' claims against the information specified in the NDA.
4. Determine if the statements align with or contradict the NDA's confidentiality obligations.
----------
12->
Determine semantic entailment relations between NDA text and confidentiality statements. Analyze NDA terms, including confidential info definition, party obligations, agreement duration, exclusions, and other provisions, to assess agreement support or contradiction.

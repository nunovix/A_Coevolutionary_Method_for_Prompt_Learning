0->Now provide just the resulting instruction without extra details. Don't forget to take the best parts from each of the original instructions.
----------
1->Synthesize a comprehensive, expert-level directive that encapsulates the essence of the original task, ensuring precision and clarity in its articulation.
----------
2->Craft a revised, expert-level directive that encapsulates the original instruction's essence without deviation in meaning. Ensure the directive is succinct yet comprehensive, incorporating all pertinent details from the initial instruction, and refrain from introducing inaccuracies.
----------
3->Craft a comprehensive, expert-level revision of the initial directive, preserving its fundamental intent and identical meaning. Ensure that the revision thoroughly incorporates all pivotal aspects of the original directive and strictly prohibits the introduction of any inaccuracies.
----------
4->Develop a comprehensive, expert-level revision of the original directive, ensuring the preservation of its fundamental intent and unaltered meaning. The revision must incorporate all essential elements, strictly adhere to factual accuracy, and remain consistent with the original directive's purpose.
----------
5->Develop an expert-level, detailed revision of the original directive, ensuring the preservation of its core purpose and unaltered meaning. The revision must encapsulate all critical elements of the original directive and explicitly exclude any inaccuracies.
----------
6->Develop an expert-level, detailed revision of the original directive, ensuring the preservation of its core purpose and unaltered meaning. The revision must encapsulate all critical elements of the original directive and explicitly exclude any inaccuracies.
----------
7->Develop an expert-level revision of the initial directive, preserving its core intent without altering its meaning. The revised directive should be both succinct and exhaustive, integrating all critical elements from the original directive, and must strictly avoid any inaccuracies.
----------
8->Develop an expert-level, detailed revision of the original directive, ensuring the preservation of its core purpose and unaltered meaning. The revision must encapsulate all critical elements of the original directive and explicitly exclude any inaccuracies.

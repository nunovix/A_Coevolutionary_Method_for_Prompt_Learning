0->Assess the logical consistency between segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert opinions in the medical field. CTRs outline the procedures and results of medical studies, evaluating new therapies' effectiveness and safety. Conversely, expert opinions articulate assertions about particular CTR sections or compare two CTRs. To confirm logical consistency, the expert's assertion must be corroborated by the CTR data and not oppose any given details.

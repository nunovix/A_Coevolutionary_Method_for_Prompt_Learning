12->

1. Analyze the medical terminology and context in the given statement and the clinical trial report data.
2. Clarify any ambiguities or missing information to maintain consistency between the two.
3. Validate the agreement in meaning and accuracy between the statement and the report by affirming "YES."
----------
13->
Assess the clinical trial report for accuracy and consistency in findings. Determine if the results are valid and free from error, delivering a clear affirmative (YES) or negative (NO) conclusion.
----------
14->
Determine if the clinical trial report data supports or is consistent with the given statement, affirming "YES" for consistency and validity.
----------
15->

Determine the concordance between the given statement and Clinical Trial Report (CTR) findings. Interpret any ambiguous medical terminology or context in both, and fill in any missing information. Render a definitive YES or NO answer based on the CTR evidence, while maintaining accuracy and thoroughness throughout the evaluation process.
----------
16->
Interpret the medical terminology and context in the statement and clinical trial reports to verify their congruence. Label as "YES" for agreement and provide any necessary clarifications or resolutions for ambiguities or missing information.
----------
17->
Assess the clinical trial report data in relation to the provided statement. If consistent, record "YES".
----------
18->

Evaluate the alignment of a given statement with the Clinical Trial Report (CTR) descriptions. This assessment necessitates understanding the medical jargon and context present in both the statement and the reports. Address any ambiguities or data insufficiencies to ensure congruence.

Affirm YES if the statement aligns and is substantiated by the CTR descriptions, otherwise, denote NO.
----------
19->

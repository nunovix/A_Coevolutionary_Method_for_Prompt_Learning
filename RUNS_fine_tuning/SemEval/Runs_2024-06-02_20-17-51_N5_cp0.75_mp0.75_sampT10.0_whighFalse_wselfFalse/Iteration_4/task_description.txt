0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.
----------
1->

Conduct a comprehensive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical expert assertions, focusing on evaluating the effectiveness and safety of new treatments. This analysis should cover: (1) Eligibility Criteria, including patient inclusion/exclusion parameters, (2) Intervention, detailing therapeutic specifics such as modality, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) Results, summarizing participant data, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and conclusions, and (4) Adverse Events, documenting observed clinical signs and symptoms. Ensure expert assertions are consistent with, supported by, and non-contradictory to CTR data for individual or comparative analyses.
----------
2->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of novel therapeutics. The analysis should encompass: (1) Rigorous evaluation of Eligibility Criteria, scrutinizing patient inclusion/exclusion parameters, (2) Comprehensive review of Interventions, detailing treatment specifics including type, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) Complete assessment of Results, summarizing participant demographics, outcome metrics, units of measurement, and derived conclusions, and (4) Meticulous documentation of Adverse Events, recording all observed adverse reactions and symptoms. Verify that expert assertions are corroborated by CTR data, are consistent with clinical trial findings, and congruent with the provided descriptions.

3->

Perform an exhaustive semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of novel treatments. The analysis must encompass: (1) Meticulous review of Eligibility Criteria, assessing patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, (2) Comprehensive review of Interventions, detailing modality, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) Rigorous evaluation of Results, recording participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and derived conclusions, and (4) Precise documentation of Adverse Events, noting any clinical signs and symptoms observed. Verify that expert assertions are corroborated by data from CTRs, are congruent with clinical trial results, and are in harmony with the provided clinical descriptions.
----------
4->

Perform an in-depth semantic entailment analysis between Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and authoritative clinical statements to confirm the efficacy and safety of novel therapies. This analysis should encompass: (1) Evaluation of Eligibility Criteria, scrutinizing patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, (2) Detailed Examination of Interventions, outlining treatment specifics including modality, dosage, administration frequency, and treatment duration, (3) Assessment of Results, taking into account participant demographics, outcome measures, units of measurement, and derived conclusions, and (4) Recording of Adverse Events, documenting any observed signs and symptoms. Ensure that expert claims are corroborated by CTR data, are in agreement with clinical trial results, and are consistent with the provided clinical descriptions.

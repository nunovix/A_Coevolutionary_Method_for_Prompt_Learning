0->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs detail the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or making a comparative analysis of two CTRs. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, finding support in the CTR and not contradicting any of the provided descriptions.
----------
1->Analyze the semantic entailment between discrete sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and assertions made by clinical domain specialists. CTRs encapsulate the procedures and results of clinical trials, assessing the effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic interventions. Validate entailment by ensuring that the expert's assertion is corroborated by the CTR data and remains consistent with the information presented.
----------
2->Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual segments of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and claims posited by clinical domain experts. CTRs document the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, determining the efficacy and safety of innovative treatments. Verify entailment by confirming that the expert's claim is substantiated by the CTR data and does not contradict any provided information.
